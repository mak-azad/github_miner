Mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.\n\n__Properties__\n* Worst case performance\tO(n log n)\n* Best case performance\tO(n)\n* Average case performance\tO(n)\n\n\n###### View the algorithm in [action][merge-toptal]\n\n## Quick\n![alt text][quick-image]\n\nFrom [Wikipedia][quick-wiki]: Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order.\n\n__Properties__\n* Worst case performance\tO(n^2)\n* Best case performance\tO(n log n) or O(n) with three-way partition\n* Average case performance\tO(n^2)\n\n###### View the algorithm in [action][quick-toptal]\n\n\n## Search Algorithms\n\n### Linear\nAdd comments here\n\n## Ciphers\n\n### Caesar\nAdd comments here\n\n[bubble-toptal]: https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms/bubble-sort\n[bubble-wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort\n[bubble-image]: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Bubblesort-edited-color.svg/220px-Bubblesort-edited-color.svg.png ""Bubble Sort""\n\n[insertion-toptal]: https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms/insertion-sort\n[insertion-wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort\n[insertion-image]: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Insertionsort-edited.png ""Insertion Sort""\n\n[quick-toptal]: https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms/quick-sort\n[quick-wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort\n[quick-image]: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Sorting_quicksort_anim.gif ""Quick Sort""\n\n[merge-toptal]: https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms/merge-sort\n[merge-wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort\n[merge-image]: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Merge-sort-example-300px.gif ""Merge Sort""\n']","[[<pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fdef1c0>, <pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fdef850>], [<pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fddd2e0>, <pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fdeaeb0>], [<pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fde4eb0>, <pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fde46d0>], [<pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fdc1970>], [<pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fe2e190>, <pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fe2e2e0>, <pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fe2e1c0>], []]","[[<pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fdefac0>], [<pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fdf6af0>], [<pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fdea700>], [<pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fdc6d60>, <pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fdc1970>, <pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fdc6eb0>], [<pydriller.domain.commit.Method object at 0x7fe24fe2eac0>], []]"

Good, bad, or indifferent, these\npapers were in a jargon that only my colleagues and a few advanced\nstudents could understand. Hence, when I was asked to do this little\nbook, I soon found it extremely difficult to say what I meant in simple\nfashion. The style is new to me, but I hope the reader will not find it\nforced or pedantic; at least I have done my very best to tell the story\nsimply and clearly.\n\nMany friends have aided in the preparation of the book. The whimsical\ncharm of Miss Susan Richerts illustrations add enormously to the\nspirit I wanted. She gave freely of her own time on the drawings and\nin planning the book with me. My colleagues at the University of\nChicago, especially Professor Wilton M. Krogman (now of the University\nof Pennsylvania), and also Mrs. Linda Braidwood, Associate of the\nOriental Institute, and Professors Fay-Cooper Cole and Sol Tax, of\nthe Department of Anthropology, gave me counsel in matters bearing on\ntheir special fields, and the Department of Anthropology bore some of\nthe expense of the illustrations. From Mrs. Irma Hunter and Mr. Arnold\nMaremont, who are not archeologists at all and have only an intelligent\nlaymans notion of archeology, I had sound advice on how best to tell\nthe story. I am deeply indebted to all these friends.\n\nWhile I was preparing the second edition, I had the great fortune\nto be able to rework the third chapter with Professor Sherwood L.\nWashburn, now of the Department of Anthropology of the University of\nCalifornia, and the fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters with Professor\nHallum L. Movius, Jr., of the Peabody Museum, Harvard University. The\nbook has gained greatly in accuracy thereby. In matters of dating,\nProfessor Movius and the indications of Professor W. F. Libbys Carbon\n14 chronology project have both encouraged me to choose the lowest\ndates now current for the events of the Pleistocene Ice Age. There is\nstill no certain way of fixing a direct chronology for most of the\nPleistocene, but Professor Libbys method appears very promising for\nits end range and for proto-historic dates. In any case, this book\nnames periods, and new dates may be written in against mine, if new\nand better dating systems appear.\n\nI wish to thank Dr. Clifford C. Gregg, Director of Chicago Natural\nHistory Museum, for the opportunity to publish this book. My old\nfriend, Dr. Paul S. Martin, Chief Curator in the Department of\nAnthropology, asked me to undertake the job and inspired me to complete\nit. I am also indebted to Miss Lillian A. Ross, Associate Editor of\nScientific Publications, and to Mr. George I. Quimby, Curator of\nExhibits in Anthropology, for all the time they have given me in\ngetting the manuscript into proper shape.\n\n            ROBERT J.

I have picked the brains of Professor F.\nClark Howell of the Department of Anthropology of the University of\nChicago in reworking the earlier chapters, and he was very patient in\nthe matter, which I sincerely appreciate.\n\nAll of Mrs. Susan Richert Allens original drawings appear, but a few\nnecessary corrections have been made in some of the charts and some new\ndrawings have been added by Mr. John Pfiffner, Staff Artist, Chicago\nNatural History Museum.\n\n            ROBERT J.

Actually, more\nthan 99 per cent of mans story is prehistory. Man is at least half a\nmillion years old, but he did not begin to write history (or to write\nanything) until about 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe men who lived in prehistoric times left us no history books, but\nthey did unintentionally leave a record of their presence and their way\nof life. This record is studied and interpreted by different kinds of\nscientists.\n\n\nSCIENTISTS WHO FIND OUT ABOUT PREHISTORIC MEN\n\nThe scientists who study the bones and teeth and any other parts\nthey find of the bodies of prehistoric men, are called _physical\nanthropologists_. Physical anthropologists are trained, much like\ndoctors, to know all about the human body. They study living people,\ntoo; they know more about the biological facts of human races than\nanybody else. If the police find a badly decayed body in a trunk,\nthey ask a physical anthropologist to tell them what the person\noriginally looked like. The physical anthropologists who specialize in\nprehistoric men work with fossils, so they are sometimes called _human\npaleontologists_.\n\n\nARCHEOLOGISTS\n\nThere is a kind of scientist who studies the things that prehistoric\nmen made and did. Such a scientist is called an _archeologist_. It is\nthe archeologists business to look for the stone and metal tools, the\npottery, the graves, and the caves or huts of the men who lived before\nhistory began.\n\nBut there is more to archeology than just looking for things. In\nProfessor V. Gordon Childes words, archeology furnishes a sort of\nhistory of human activity, provided always that the actions have\nproduced concrete results and left recognizable material traces. You\nwill see that there are at least three points in what Childe says:\n\n  1. The archeologists have to find the traces of things left behind by\n     ancient man, and\n\n  2. Only a few objects may be found, for most of these were probably\n     too soft or too breakable to last through the years. However,\n\n  3. The archeologist must use whatever he can find to tell a story--to\n     make a sort of history--from the objects and living-places and\n     graves that have escaped destruction.\n\nWhat I mean is this: Let us say you are walking through a dump yard,\nand you find a rusty old spark plug. If you want to think about what\nthe spark plug means, you quickly remember that it is a part of an\nautomobile motor. This tells you something about the man who threw\nthe spark plug on the dump. He either had an automobile, or he knew\nor lived near someone who did. He cant have lived so very long ago,\nyoull remember, because spark plugs and automobiles are only about\nsixty years old.\n\nWhen you think about the old spark plug in this way you have\njust been making the beginnings of what we call an archeological\n_interpretation_; you have been making the spark plug tell a story.\nIt is the same way with the man-made things we archeologists find\nand put in museums. Usually, only a few of these objects are pretty\nto look at; but each of them has some sort of story to tell. Making\nthe interpretation of his finds is the most important part of the\narcheologists job. It is the way he gets at the sort of history of\nhuman activity which is expected of archeology.\n\n\nSOME OTHER SCIENTISTS\n\nThere are many other scientists who help the archeologist and the\nphysical anthropologist find out about prehistoric men. The geologists\nhelp us tell the age of the rocks or caves or gravel beds in which\nhuman bones or man-made objects are found. There are other scientists\nwith names which all begin with paleo (the Greek word for old). The\n_paleontologists_ study fossil animals. There are also, for example,\nsuch scientists as _paleobotanists_ and _paleoclimatologists_, who\nstudy ancient plants and climates. These scientists help us to know\nthe kinds of animals and plants that were living in prehistoric times\nand so could be used for food by ancient man; what the weather was\nlike; and whether there were glaciers. Also, when I tell you that\nprehistoric men did not appear until long after the great dinosaurs had\ndisappeared, I go on the say-so of the paleontologists. They know that\nfossils of men and of dinosaurs are not found in the same geological\nperiod. The dinosaur fossils come in early periods, the fossils of men\nmuch later.\n\nSince World War II even the atomic scientists have been helping the\narcheologists. By testing the amount of radioactivity left in charcoal,\nwood, or other vegetable matter obtained from archeological sites, they\nhave been able to date the sites. Shell has been used also, and even\nthe hair of Egyptian mummies. The dates of geological and climatic\nevents have also been discovered. Some of this work has been done from\ndrillings taken from the bottom of the sea.\n\nThis dating by radioactivity has considerably shortened the dates which\nthe archeologists used to give. If you find that some of the dates\nI give here are more recent than the dates you see in other books\non prehistory, it is because I am using one of the new lower dating\nsystems.\n\n[Illustration: RADIOCARBON CHART\n\nThe rate of disappearance of radioactivity as time passes.[1]]\n\n  [1] It is important that the limitations of the radioactive carbon\n      dating system be held in mind. As the statistics involved in\n      the system are used, there are two chances in three that the\n      date of the sample falls within the range given as plus or\n      minus an added number of years. For example, the date for the\n      Jarmo village (see chart), given as 6750  200 B.C., really\n      means that there are only two chances in three that the real\n      date of the charcoal sampled fell between 6950 and 6550 B.C.\n      We have also begun to suspect that there are ways in which the\n      samples themselves may have become contaminated, either on\n      the early or on the late side. We now tend to be suspicious of\n      single radioactive carbon determinations, or of determinations\n      from one site alone. But as a fabric of consistent\n      determinations for several or more sites of one archeological\n      period, we gain confidence in the dates.\n\n\nHOW THE SCIENTISTS FIND OUT\n\nSo far, this chapter has been mainly about the people who find out\nabout prehistoric men. We also need a word about _how_ they find out.\n\nAll our finds came by accident until about a hundred years ago. Men\ndigging wells, or digging in caves for fertilizer, often turned up\nancient swords or pots or stone arrowheads. People also found some odd\npieces of stone that didnt look like natural forms, but they also\ndidnt look like any known tool. As a result, the people who found them\ngave them queer names; for example, thunderbolts. The people thought\nthe strange stones came to earth as bolts of lightning. We know now\nthat these strange stones were prehistoric stone tools.\n\nMany important finds still come to us by accident. In 1935, a British\ndentist, A. T. Marston, found the first of two fragments of a very\nimportant fossil human skull, in a gravel pit at Swanscombe, on the\nRiver Thames, England. He had to wait nine months, until the face of\nthe gravel pit had been dug eight yards farther back, before the second\nfragment appeared. They fitted! Then, twenty years later, still another\npiece appeared. In 1928 workmen who were blasting out rock for the\nbreakwater in the port of Haifa began to notice flint tools. Thus the\nstory of cave men on Mount Carmel, in Palestine, began to be known.\n\nPlanned archeological digging is only about a century old. Even before\nthis, however, a few men realized the significance of objects they dug\nfrom the ground; one of these early archeologists was our own Thomas\nJefferson. The first real mound-digger was a German grocers clerk,\nHeinrich Schliemann. Schliemann made a fortune as a merchant, first\nin Europe and then in the California gold-rush of 1849. He became an\nAmerican citizen. Then he retired and had both money and time to test\nan old idea of his. He believed that the heroes of ancient Troy and\nMycenae were once real Trojans and Greeks. He proved it by going to\nTurkey and Greece and digging up the remains of both cities.\n\nSchliemann had the great good fortune to find rich and spectacular\ntreasures, and he also had the common sense to keep notes and make\ndescriptions of what he found. He proved beyond doubt that many ancient\ncity mounds can be _stratified_. This means that there may be the\nremains of many towns in a mound, one above another, like layers in a\ncake.\n\nYou might like to have an idea of how mounds come to be in layers.\nThe original settlers may have chosen the spot because it had a good\nspring and there were good fertile lands nearby, or perhaps because\nit was close to some road or river or harbor. These settlers probably\nbuilt their town of stone and mud-brick. Finally, something would have\nhappened to the town--a flood, or a burning, or a raid by enemies--and\nthe walls of the houses would have fallen in or would have melted down\nas mud in the rain. Nothing would have remained but the mud and debris\nof a low mound of _one_ layer.\n\nThe second settlers would have wanted the spot for the same reasons\nthe first settlers did--good water, land, and roads. Also, the second\nsettlers would have found a nice low mound to build their houses on,\na protection from floods. But again, something would finally have\nhappened to the second town, and the walls of _its_ houses would have\ncome tumbling down. This makes the _second_ layer. And so on....\n\nIn Syria I once had the good fortune to dig on a large mound that had\nno less than fifteen layers. Also, most of the layers were thick, and\nthere were signs of rebuilding and repairs within each layer. The mound\nwas more than a hundred feet high. In each layer, the building material\nused had been a soft, unbaked mud-brick, and most of the debris\nconsisted of fallen or rain-melted mud from these mud-bricks.\n\nThis idea of _stratification_, like the cake layers, was already a\nfamiliar one to the geologists by Schliemanns time. They could show\nthat their lowest layer of rock was oldest or earliest, and that the\noverlying layers became more recent as one moved upward. Schliemanns\ndigging proved the same thing at Troy. His first (lowest and earliest)\ncity had at least nine layers above it; he thought that the second\nlayer contained the remains of Homers Troy. We now know that Homeric\nTroy was layer VIIa from the bottom; also, we count eleven layers or\nsub-layers in total.\n\nSchliemanns work marks the beginnings of modern archeology. Scholars\nsoon set out to dig on ancient sites, from Egypt to Central America.\n\n\nARCHEOLOGICAL INFORMATION\n\nAs time went on, the study of archeological materials--found either\nby accident or by digging on purpose--began to show certain things.\nArcheologists began to get ideas as to the kinds of objects that\nbelonged together. If you compared a mail-order catalogue of 1890 with\none of today, you would see a lot of differences. If you really studied\nthe two catalogues hard, you would also begin to see that certain\nobjects go together. Horseshoes and metal buggy tires and pieces of\nharness would begin to fit into a picture with certain kinds of coal\nstoves and furniture and china dishes and kerosene lamps. Our friend\nthe spark plug, and radios and electric refrigerators and light bulbs\nwould fit into a picture with different kinds of furniture and dishes\nand tools. You wont be old enough to remember the kind of hats that\nwomen wore in 1890, but youve probably seen pictures of them, and you\nknow very well they couldnt be worn with the fashions of today.\n\nThis is one of the ways that archeologists study their materials.\nThe various tools and weapons and jewelry, the pottery, the kinds\nof houses, and even the ways of burying the dead tend to fit into\npictures. Some archeologists call all of the things that go together to\nmake such a picture an _assemblage_. The assemblage of the first layer\nof Schliemanns Troy was as different from that of the seventh layer as\nour 1900 mail-order catalogue is from the one of today.\n\nThe archeologists who came after Schliemann began to notice other\nthings and to compare them with occurrences in modern times. The\nidea that people will buy better mousetraps goes back into very\nancient times. Today, if we make good automobiles or radios, we can\nsell some of them in Turkey or even in Timbuktu. This means that a\nfew present-day types of American automobiles and radios form part\nof present-day assemblages in both Turkey and Timbuktu. The total\npresent-day assemblage of Turkey is quite different from that of\nTimbuktu or that of America, but they have at least some automobiles\nand some radios in common.\n\nNow these automobiles and radios will eventually wear out. Let us\nsuppose we could go to some remote part of Turkey or to Timbuktu in a\ndream. We dont know what the date is, in our dream, but we see all\nsorts of strange things and ways of living in both places. Nobody\ntells us what the date is. But suddenly we see a 1936 Ford; so we\nknow that in our dream it has to be at least the year 1936, and only\nas many years after that as we could reasonably expect a Ford to keep\nin running order. The Ford would probably break down in twenty years\ntime, so the Turkish or Timbuktu assemblage were seeing in our dream\nhas to date at about A.D. 1936-56.\n\nArcheologists not only date their ancient materials in this way; they\nalso see over what distances and between which peoples trading was\ndone. It turns out that there was a good deal of trading in ancient\ntimes, probably all on a barter and exchange basis.\n\n\nEVERYTHING BEGINS TO FIT TOGETHER\n\nNow we need to pull these ideas all together and see the complicated\nstructure the archeologists can build with their materials.\n\nEven the earliest archeologists soon found that there was a very long\nrange of prehistoric time which would yield only very simple things.\nFor this very long early part of prehistory, there was little to be\nfound but the flint tools which wandering, hunting and gathering\npeople made, and the bones of the wild animals they ate. Toward the\nend of prehistoric time there was a general settling down with the\ncoming of agriculture, and all sorts of new things began to be made.\nArcheologists soon got a general notion of what ought to appear with\nwhat. Thus, it would upset a French prehistorian digging at the bottom\nof a very early cave if he found a fine bronze sword, just as much as\nit would upset him if he found a beer bottle. The people of his very\nearly cave layer simply could not have made bronze swords, which came\nlater, just as do beer bottles. Some accidental disturbance of the\nlayers of his cave must have happened.\n\nWith any luck, archeologists do their digging in a layered, stratified\nsite. They find the remains of everything that would last through\ntime, in several different layers. They know that the assemblage in\nthe bottom layer was laid down earlier than the assemblage in the next\nlayer above, and so on up to the topmost layer, which is the latest.\nThey look at the results of other digs and find that some other\narcheologist 900 miles away has found ax-heads in his lowest layer,\nexactly like the ax-heads of their fifth layer. This means that their\nfifth layer must have been lived in at about the same time as was the\nfirst layer in the site 200 miles away. It also may mean that the\npeople who lived in the two layers knew and traded with each other. Or\nit could mean that they didnt necessarily know each other, but simply\nthat both traded with a third group at about the same time.\n\nYou can see that the more we dig and find, the more clearly the main\nfacts begin to stand out. We begin to be more sure of which people\nlived at the same time, which earlier and which later. We begin to\nknow who traded with whom, and which peoples seemed to live off by\nthemselves. We begin to find enough skeletons in burials so that the\nphysical anthropologists can tell us what the people looked like. We\nget animal bones, and a paleontologist may tell us they are all bones\nof wild animals; or he may tell us that some or most of the bones are\nthose of domesticated animals, for instance, sheep or cattle, and\ntherefore the people must have kept herds.\n\nMore important than anything else--as our structure grows more\ncomplicated and our materials increase--is the fact that a sort\nof history of human activity does begin to appear. The habits or\ntraditions that men formed in the making of their tools and in the\nways they did things, begin to stand out for us. How characteristic\nwere these habits and traditions? What areas did they spread over?\nHow long did they last? We watch the different tools and the traces\nof the way things were done--how the burials were arranged, what\nthe living-places were like, and so on. We wonder about the people\nthemselves, for the traces of habits and traditions are useful to us\nonly as clues to the men who once had them. So we ask the physical\nanthropologists about the skeletons that we found in the burials. The\nphysical anthropologists tell us about the anatomy and the similarities\nand differences which the skeletons show when compared with other\nskeletons. The physical anthropologists are even working on a\nmethod--chemical tests of the bones--that will enable them to discover\nwhat the blood-type may have been. One thing is sure. We have never\nfound a group of skeletons so absolutely similar among themselves--so\ncast from a single mould, so to speak--that we could claim to have a\npure race. I am sure we never shall.\n\nWe become particularly interested in any signs of change--when new\nmaterials and tool types and ways of doing things replace old ones. We\nwatch for signs of social change and progress in one way or another.\n\nWe must do all this without one word of written history to aid us.\nEverything we are concerned with goes back to the time _before_ men\nlearned to write. That is the prehistorians job--to find out what\nhappened before history began.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CHANGING WORLD in which Prehistoric Men Lived\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nMankind, well say, is at least a half million years old. It is very\nhard to understand how long a time half a million years really is.\nIf we were to compare this whole length of time to one day, wed get\nsomething like this: The present time is midnight, and Jesus was\nborn just five minutes and thirty-six seconds ago. Earliest history\nbegan less than fifteen minutes ago. Everything before 11:45 was in\nprehistoric time.\n\nOr maybe we can grasp the length of time better in terms of\ngenerations. As you know, primitive peoples tend to marry and have\nchildren rather early in life. So suppose we say that twenty years\nwill make an average generation. At this rate there would be 25,000\ngenerations in a half-million years. But our United States is much less\nthan ten generations old, twenty-five generations take us back before\nthe time of Columbus, Julius Caesar was alive just 100 generations ago,\nDavid was king of Israel less than 150 generations ago, 250 generations\ntake us back to the beginning of written history. And there were 24,750\ngenerations of men before written history began!\n\nI should probably tell you that there is a new method of prehistoric\ndating which would cut the earliest dates in my reckoning almost\nin half. Dr. Cesare Emiliani, combining radioactive (C14) and\nchemical (oxygen isotope) methods in the study of deep-sea borings,\nhas developed a system which would lower the total range of human\nprehistory to about 300,000 years. The system is still too new to have\nhad general examination and testing. Hence, I have not used it in this\nbook; it would mainly affect the dates earlier than 25,000 years ago.\n\n\nCHANGES IN ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe earth probably hasnt changed much in the last 5,000 years (250\ngenerations). Men have built things on its surface and dug into it and\ndrawn boundaries on maps of it, but the places where rivers, lakes,\nseas, and mountains now stand have changed very little.\n\nIn earlier times the earth looked very different. Geologists call the\nlast great geological period the _Pleistocene_. It began somewhere\nbetween a half million and a million years ago, and was a time of great\nchanges. Sometimes we call it the Ice Age, for in the Pleistocene\nthere were at least three or four times when large areas of earth\nwere covered with glaciers. The reason for my uncertainty is that\nwhile there seem to have been four major mountain or alpine phases of\nglaciation, there may only have been three general continental phases\nin the Old World.[2]\n\n  [2] This is a complicated affair and I do not want to bother you\n      with its details. Both the alpine and the continental ice sheets\n      seem to have had minor fluctuations during their _main_ phases,\n      and the advances of the later phases destroyed many of the\n      traces of the earlier phases. The general textbooks have tended\n      to follow the names and numbers established for the Alps early\n      in this century by two German geologists. I will not bother you\n      with the names, but there were _four_ major phases. It is the\n      second of these alpine phases which seems to fit the traces of\n      the earliest of the great continental glaciations. In this book,\n      I will use the four-part system, since it is the most familiar,\n      but will add the word _alpine_ so you may remember to make the\n      transition to the continental system if you wish to do so.\n\nGlaciers are great sheets of ice, sometimes over a thousand feet\nthick, which are now known only in Greenland and Antarctica and in\nhigh mountains. During several of the glacial periods in the Ice Age,\nthe glaciers covered most of Canada and the northern United States and\nreached down to southern England and France in Europe. Smaller ice\nsheets sat like caps on the Rockies, the Alps, and the Himalayas. The\ncontinental glaciation only happened north of the equator, however, so\nremember that Ice Age is only half true.\n\nAs you know, the amount of water on and about the earth does not vary.\nThese large glaciers contained millions of tons of water frozen into\nice. Because so much water was frozen and contained in the glaciers,\nthe water level of lakes and oceans was lowered. Flooded areas were\ndrained and appeared as dry land. There were times in the Ice Age when\nthere was no English Channel, so that England was not an island, and a\nland bridge at the Dardanelles probably divided the Mediterranean from\nthe Black Sea.\n\nA very important thing for people living during the time of a\nglaciation was the region adjacent to the glacier. They could not, of\ncourse, live on the ice itself. The questions would be how close could\nthey live to it, and how would they have had to change their way of\nlife to do so.\n\n\nGLACIERS CHANGE THE WEATHER\n\nGreat sheets of ice change the weather. When the front of a glacier\nstood at Milwaukee, the weather must have been bitterly cold in\nChicago. The climate of the whole world would have been different, and\nyou can see how animals and men would have been forced to move from one\nplace to another in search of food and warmth.\n\nOn the other hand, it looks as if only a minor proportion of the whole\nIce Age was really taken up by times of glaciation. In between came\nthe _interglacial_ periods. During these times the climate around\nChicago was as warm as it is now, and sometimes even warmer. It may\ninterest you to know that the last great glacier melted away less than\n10,000 years ago. Professor Ernst Antevs thinks we may be living in an\ninterglacial period and that the Ice Age may not be over yet. So if you\nwant to make a killing in real estate for your several hundred times\ngreat-grandchildren, you might buy some land in the Arizona desert or\nthe Sahara.\n\nWe do not yet know just why the glaciers appeared and disappeared, as\nthey did. It surely had something to do with an increase in rainfall\nand a fall in temperature. It probably also had to do with a general\ntendency for the land to rise at the beginning of the Pleistocene. We\nknow there was some mountain-building at that time. Hence, rain-bearing\nwinds nourished the rising and cooler uplands with snow. An increase\nin all three of these factors--if they came together--would only have\nneeded to be slight. But exactly why this happened we do not know.\n\nThe reason I tell you about the glaciers is simply to remind you of the\nchanging world in which prehistoric men lived. Their surroundings--the\nanimals and plants they used for food, and the weather they had to\nprotect themselves from--were always changing. On the other hand, this\nchange happened over so long a period of time and was so slow that\nindividual people could not have noticed it. Glaciers, about which they\nprobably knew nothing, moved in hundreds of miles to the north of them.\nThe people must simply have wandered ever more southward in search\nof the plants and animals on which they lived. Or some men may have\nstayed where they were and learned to hunt different animals and eat\ndifferent foods. Prehistoric men had to keep adapting themselves to new\nenvironments and those who were most adaptive were most successful.\n\n\nOTHER CHANGES\n\nChanges took place in the men themselves as well as in the ways they\nlived. As time went on, they made better tools and weapons. Then, too,\nwe begin to find signs of how they started thinking of other things\nthan food and the tools to get it with. We find that they painted on\nthe walls of caves, and decorated their tools; we find that they buried\ntheir dead.\n\nAt about the time when the last great glacier was finally melting away,\nmen in the Near East made the first basic change in human economy.\nThey began to plant grain, and they learned to raise and herd certain\nanimals. This meant that they could store food in granaries and on the\nhoof against the bad times of the year. This first really basic change\nin mans way of living has been called the food-producing revolution.\nBy the time it happened, a modern kind of climate was beginning. Men\nhad already grown to look as they do now. Know-how in ways of living\nhad developed and progressed, slowly but surely, up to a point. It was\nimpossible for men to go beyond that point if they only hunted and\nfished and gathered wild foods. Once the basic change was made--once\nthe food-producing revolution became effective--technology leaped ahead\nand civilization and written history soon began.\n\n\n\n\nPrehistoric Men THEMSELVES\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nDO WE KNOW WHERE MAN ORIGINATED?\n\nFor a long time some scientists thought the cradle of mankind was in\ncentral Asia. Other scientists insisted it was in Africa, and still\nothers said it might have been in Europe. Actually, we dont know\nwhere it was. We dont even know that there was only _one_ cradle.\nIf we had to choose a cradle at this moment, we would probably say\nAfrica. But the southern portions of Asia and Europe may also have been\nincluded in the general area. The scene of the early development of\nmankind was certainly the Old World. It is pretty certain men didnt\nreach North or South America until almost the end of the Ice Age--had\nthey done so earlier we would certainly have found some trace of them\nby now.\n\nThe earliest tools we have yet found come from central and south\nAfrica. By the dating system Im using, these tools must be over\n500,000 years old. There are now reports that a few such early tools\nhave been found--at the Sterkfontein cave in South Africa--along with\nthe bones of small fossil men called australopithecines.\n\nNot all scientists would agree that the australopithecines were men,\nor would agree that the tools were made by the australopithecines\nthemselves. For these sticklers, the earliest bones of men come from\nthe island of Java. The date would be about 450,000 years ago. So far,\nwe have not yet found the tools which we suppose these earliest men in\nthe Far East must have made.\n\nLet me say it another way. How old are the earliest traces of men we\nnow have? Over half a million years. This was a time when the first\nalpine glaciation was happening in the north. What has been found so\nfar? The tools which the men of those times made, in different parts\nof Africa. It is now fairly generally agreed that the men who made\nthe tools were the australopithecines. There is also a more man-like\njawbone at Kanam in Kenya, but its find-spot has been questioned. The\nnext earliest bones we have were found in Java, and they may be almost\na hundred thousand years younger than the earliest African finds. We\nhavent yet found the tools of these early Javanese. Our knowledge of\ntool-using in Africa spreads quickly as time goes on: soon after the\nappearance of tools in the south we shall have them from as far north\nas Algeria.\n\nVery soon after the earliest Javanese come the bones of slightly more\ndeveloped people in Java, and the jawbone of a man who once lived in\nwhat is now Germany. The same general glacial beds which yielded the\nlater Javanese bones and the German jawbone also include tools. These\nfinds come from the time of the second alpine glaciation.\n\nSo this is the situation. By the time of the end of the second alpine\nor first continental glaciation (say 400,000 years ago) we have traces\nof men from the extremes of the more southerly portions of the Old\nWorld--South Africa, eastern Asia, and western Europe. There are also\nsome traces of men in the middle ground. In fact, Professor Franz\nWeidenreich believed that creatures who were the immediate ancestors\nof men had already spread over Europe, Africa, and Asia by the time\nthe Ice Age began. We certainly have no reason to disbelieve this, but\nfortunate accidents of discovery have not yet given us the evidence to\nprove it.\n\n\nMEN AND APES\n\nMany people used to get extremely upset at the ill-formed notion\nthat man descended from the apes. Such words were much more likely\nto start fights or monkey trials than the correct notion that all\nliving animals, including man, ascended or evolved from a single-celled\norganism which lived in the primeval seas hundreds of millions of years\nago. Men are mammals, of the order called Primates, and mans living\nrelatives are the great apes. Men didnt descend from the apes or\napes from men, and mankind must have had much closer relatives who have\nsince become extinct.\n\nMen stand erect. They also walk and run on their two feet. Apes are\nhappiest in trees, swinging with their arms from branch to branch.\nFew branches of trees will hold the mighty gorilla, although he still\nmanages to sleep in trees. Apes cant stand really erect in our sense,\nand when they have to run on the ground, they use the knuckles of their\nhands as well as their feet.\n\nA key group of fossil bones here are the south African\naustralopithecines. These are called the _Australopithecinae_ or\nman-apes or sometimes even ape-men. We do not _know_ that they were\ndirectly ancestral to men but they can hardly have been so to apes.\nPresently Ill describe them a bit more. The reason I mention them\nhere is that while they had brains no larger than those of apes, their\nhipbones were enough like ours so that they must have stood erect.\nThere is no good reason to think they couldnt have walked as we do.\n\n\nBRAINS, HANDS, AND TOOLS\n\nWhether the australopithecines were our ancestors or not, the proper\nancestors of men must have been able to stand erect and to walk on\ntheir two feet. Three further important things probably were involved,\nnext, before they could become men proper. These are:\n\n  1. The increasing size and development of the brain.\n\n  2. The increasing usefulness (specialization) of the thumb and hand.\n\n  3. The use of tools.\n\nNobody knows which of these three is most important, or which came\nfirst. Most probably the growth of all three things was very much\nblended together. If you think about each of the things, you will see\nwhat I mean. Unless your hand is more flexible than a paw, and your\nthumb will work against (or oppose) your fingers, you cant hold a tool\nvery well. But you wouldnt get the idea of using a tool unless you had\nenough brain to help you see cause and effect. And it is rather hard to\nsee how your hand and brain would develop unless they had something to\npractice on--like using tools. In Professor Krogmans words, the hand\nmust become the obedient servant of the eye and the brain. It is the\n_co-ordination_ of these things that counts.\n\nMany other things must have been happening to the bodies of the\ncreatures who were the ancestors of men. Our ancestors had to develop\norgans of speech. More than that, they had to get the idea of letting\n_certain sounds_ made with these speech organs have _certain meanings_.\n\nAll this must have gone very slowly. Probably everything was developing\nlittle by little, all together. Men became men very slowly.\n\n\nWHEN SHALL WE CALL MEN MEN?\n\nWhat do I mean when I say men? People who looked pretty much as we\ndo, and who used different tools to do different things, are men to me.\nWell probably never know whether the earliest ones talked or not. They\nprobably had vocal cords, so they could make sounds, but did they know\nhow to make sounds work as symbols to carry meanings? But if the fossil\nbones look like our skeletons, and if we find tools which well agree\ncouldnt have been made by nature or by animals, then Id say we had\ntraces of _men_.\n\nThe australopithecine finds of the Transvaal and Bechuanaland, in\nsouth Africa, are bound to come into the discussion here. Ive already\ntold you that the australopithecines could have stood upright and\nwalked on their two hind legs. They come from the very base of the\nPleistocene or Ice Age, and a few coarse stone tools have been found\nwith the australopithecine fossils. But there are three varieties\nof the australopithecines and they last on until a time equal to\nthat of the second alpine glaciation. They are the best suggestion\nwe have yet as to what the ancestors of men _may_ have looked like.\nThey were certainly closer to men than to apes. Although their brain\nsize was no larger than the brains of modern apes their body size and\nstature were quite small; hence, relative to their small size, their\nbrains were large. We have not been able to prove without doubt that\nthe australopithecines were _tool-making_ creatures, even though the\nrecent news has it that tools have been found with australopithecine\nbones. The doubt as to whether the australopithecines used the tools\nthemselves goes like this--just suppose some man-like creature (whose\nbones we have not yet found) made the tools and used them to kill\nand butcher australopithecines. Hence a few experts tend to let\naustralopithecines still hang in limbo as man-apes.\n\n\nTHE EARLIEST MEN WE KNOW\n\nIll postpone talking about the tools of early men until the next\nchapter. The men whose bones were the earliest of the Java lot have\nbeen given the name _Meganthropus_. The bones are very fragmentary. We\nwould not understand them very well unless we had the somewhat later\nJavanese lot--the more commonly known _Pithecanthropus_ or Java\nman--against which to refer them for study. One of the less well-known\nand earliest fragments, a piece of lower jaw and some teeth, rather\nstrongly resembles the lower jaws and teeth of the australopithecine\ntype. Was _Meganthropus_ a sort of half-way point between the\naustralopithecines and _Pithecanthropus_? It is still too early to say.\nWe shall need more finds before we can be definite one way or the other.\n\nJava man, _Pithecanthropus_, comes from geological beds equal in age\nto the latter part of the second alpine glaciation; the _Meganthropus_\nfinds refer to beds of the beginning of this glaciation. The first\nfinds of Java man were made in 1891-92 by Dr. Eugene Dubois, a Dutch\ndoctor in the colonial service. Finds have continued to be made. There\nare now bones enough to account for four skulls. There are also four\njaws and some odd teeth and thigh bones. Java man, generally speaking,\nwas about five feet six inches tall, and didnt hold his head very\nerect. His skull was very thick and heavy and had room for little more\nthan two-thirds as large a brain as we have. He had big teeth and a big\njaw and enormous eyebrow ridges.\n\nNo tools were found in the geological deposits where bones of Java man\nappeared. There are some tools in the same general area, but they come\na bit later in time. One reason we accept the Java man as man--aside\nfrom his general anatomical appearance--is that these tools probably\nbelonged to his near descendants.\n\nRemember that there are several varieties of men in the whole early\nJava lot, at least two of which are earlier than the _Pithecanthropus_,\nJava man. Some of the earlier ones seem to have gone in for\nbigness, in tooth-size at least. _Meganthropus_ is one of these\nearlier varieties. As we said, he _may_ turn out to be a link to\nthe australopithecines, who _may_ or _may not_ be ancestral to men.\n_Meganthropus_ is best understandable in terms of _Pithecanthropus_,\nwho appeared later in the same general area. _Pithecanthropus_ is\npretty well understandable from the bones he left us, and also because\nof his strong resemblance to the fully tool-using cave-dwelling Peking\nman, _Sinanthropus_, about whom we shall talk next. But you can see\nthat the physical anthropologists and prehistoric archeologists still\nhave a lot of work to do on the problem of earliest men.\n\n\nPEKING MEN AND SOME EARLY WESTERNERS\n\nThe earliest known Chinese are called _Sinanthropus_, or Peking man,\nbecause the finds were made near that city. In World War II, the United\nStates Marine guard at our Embassy in Peking tried to help get the\nbones out of the city before the Japanese attack. Nobody knows where\nthese bones are now. The Red Chinese accuse us of having stolen them.\nThey were last seen on a dock-side at a Chinese port. But should you\ncatch a Marine with a sack of old bones, perhaps we could achieve peace\nin Asia by returning them! Fortunately, there is a complete set of\ncasts of the bones.\n\nPeking man lived in a cave in a limestone hill, made tools, cracked\nanimal bones to get the marrow out, and used fire. Incidentally, the\nbones of Peking man were found because Chinese dig for what they call\ndragon bones and dragon teeth. Uneducated Chinese buy these things\nin their drug stores and grind them into powder for medicine. The\ndragon teeth and bones are really fossils of ancient animals, and\nsometimes of men. The people who supply the drug stores have learned\nwhere to dig for strange bones and teeth. Paleontologists who get to\nChina go to the drug stores to buy fossils. In a roundabout way, this\nis how the fallen-in cave of Peking man at Choukoutien was discovered.\n\nPeking man was not quite as tall as Java man but he probably stood\nstraighter. His skull looked very much like that of the Java skull\nexcept that it had room for a slightly larger brain. His face was less\nbrutish than was Java mans face, but this isnt saying much.\n\nPeking man dates from early in the interglacial period following the\nsecond alpine glaciation. He probably lived close to 350,000 years\nago. There are several finds to account for in Europe by about this\ntime, and one from northwest Africa. The very large jawbone found\nnear Heidelberg in Germany is doubtless even earlier than Peking man.\nThe beds where it was found are of second alpine glacial times, and\nrecently some tools have been said to have come from the same beds.\nThere is not much I need tell you about the Heidelberg jaw save that it\nseems certainly to have belonged to an early man, and that it is very\nbig.\n\nAnother find in Germany was made at Steinheim. It consists of the\nfragmentary skull of a man. It is very important because of its\nrelative completeness, but it has not yet been fully studied. The bone\nis thick, but the back of the head is neither very low nor primitive,\nand the face is also not primitive. The forehead does, however, have\nbig ridges over the eyes. The more fragmentary skull from Swanscombe in\nEngland (p. 11) has been much more carefully studied. Only the top and\nback of that skull have been found. Since the skull rounds up nicely,\nit has been assumed that the face and forehead must have been quite\nmodern. Careful comparison with Steinheim shows that this was not\nnecessarily so. This is important because it bears on the question of\nhow early truly modern man appeared.\n\nRecently two fragmentary jaws were found at Ternafine in Algeria,\nnorthwest Africa. They look like the jaws of Peking man. Tools were\nfound with them. Since no jaws have yet been found at Steinheim or\nSwanscombe, but the time is the same, one wonders if these people had\njaws like those of Ternafine.\n\n\nWHAT HAPPENED TO JAVA AND PEKING MEN\n\nProfessor Weidenreich thought that there were at least a dozen ways in\nwhich the Peking man resembled the modern Mongoloids. This would seem\nto indicate that Peking man was really just a very early Chinese.\n\nSeveral later fossil men have been found in the Java-Australian area.\nThe best known of these is the so-called Solo man. There are some finds\nfrom Australia itself which we now know to be quite late. But it looks\nas if we may assume a line of evolution from Java man down to the\nmodern Australian natives. During parts of the Ice Age there was a land\nbridge all the way from Java to Australia.\n\n\nTWO ENGLISHMEN WHO WERENT OLD\n\nThe older textbooks contain descriptions of two English finds which\nwere thought to be very old. These were called Piltdown (_Eoanthropus\ndawsoni_) and Galley Hill. The skulls were very modern in appearance.\nIn 1948-49, British scientists began making chemical tests which proved\nthat neither of these finds is very old. It is now known that both\nPiltdown man and the tools which were said to have been found with\nhim were part of an elaborate fake!\n\n\nTYPICAL CAVE MEN\n\nThe next men we have to talk about are all members of a related group.\nThese are the Neanderthal group. Neanderthal man himself was found in\nthe Neander Valley, near Dsseldorf, Germany, in 1856. He was the first\nhuman fossil to be recognized as such.\n\n[Illustration: PRINCIPAL KNOWN TYPES OF FOSSIL MEN\n\n  CRO-MAGNON\n  NEANDERTHAL\n  MODERN SKULL\n  COMBE-CAPELLE\n  SINANTHROPUS\n  PITHECANTHROPUS]\n\nSome of us think that the neanderthaloids proper are only those people\nof western Europe who didnt get out before the beginning of the last\ngreat glaciation, and who found themselves hemmed in by the glaciers\nin the Alps and northern Europe. Being hemmed in, they intermarried\na bit too much and developed into a special type. Professor F. Clark\nHowell sees it this way. In Europe, the earliest trace of men we\nnow know is the Heidelberg jaw. Evolution continued in Europe, from\nHeidelberg through the Swanscombe and Steinheim types to a group of\npre-neanderthaloids. There are traces of these pre-neanderthaloids\npretty much throughout Europe during the third interglacial period--say\n100,000 years ago. The pre-neanderthaloids are represented by such\nfinds as the ones at Ehringsdorf in Germany and Saccopastore in Italy.\nI wont describe them for you, since they are simply less extreme than\nthe neanderthaloids proper--about half way between Steinheim and the\nclassic Neanderthal people.\n\nProfessor Howell believes that the pre-neanderthaloids who happened to\nget caught in the pocket of the southwest corner of Europe at the onset\nof the last great glaciation became the classic Neanderthalers. Out in\nthe Near East, Howell thinks, it is possible to see traces of people\nevolving from the pre-neanderthaloid type toward that of fully modern\nman. Certainly, we dont see such extreme cases of neanderthaloidism\noutside of western Europe.\n\nThere are at least a dozen good examples in the main or classic\nNeanderthal group in Europe. They date to just before and in the\nearlier part of the last great glaciation (85,000 to 40,000 years ago).\nMany of the finds have been made in caves. The cave men the movies\nand the cartoonists show you are probably meant to be Neanderthalers.\nIm not at all sure they dragged their women by the hair; the women\nwere probably pretty tough, too!\n\nNeanderthal men had large bony heads, but plenty of room for brains.\nSome had brain cases even larger than the average for modern man. Their\nfaces were heavy, and they had eyebrow ridges of bone, but the ridges\nwere not as big as those of Java man. Their foreheads were very low,\nand they didnt have much chin. They were about five feet three inches\ntall, but were heavy and barrel-chested. But the Neanderthalers didnt\nslouch as much as theyve been blamed for, either.\n\nOne important thing about the Neanderthal group is that there is a fair\nnumber of them to study. Just as important is the fact that we know\nsomething about how they lived, and about some of the tools they made.\n\n\nOTHER MEN CONTEMPORARY WITH THE NEANDERTHALOIDS\n\nWe have seen that the neanderthaloids seem to be a specialization\nin a corner of Europe. What was going on elsewhere? We think that\nthe pre-neanderthaloid type was a generally widespread form of men.\nFrom this type evolved other more or less extreme although generally\nrelated men. The Solo finds in Java form one such case. Another was the\nRhodesian man of Africa, and the more recent Hopefield finds show more\nof the general Rhodesian type. It is more confusing than it needs to be\nif these cases outside western Europe are called neanderthaloids. They\nlived during the same approximate time range but they were all somewhat\ndifferent-looking people.\n\n\nEARLY MODERN MEN\n\nHow early is modern man (_Homo sapiens_), the wise man? Some people\nhave thought that he was very early, a few still think so. Piltdown\nand Galley Hill, which were quite modern in anatomical appearance and\n_supposedly_ very early in date, were the best evidence for very\nearly modern men. Now that Piltdown has been liquidated and Galley Hill\nis known to be very late, what is left of the idea?\n\nThe backs of the skulls of the Swanscombe and Steinheim finds look\nrather modern. Unless you pay attention to the face and forehead of the\nSteinheim find--which not many people have--and perhaps also consider\nthe Ternafine jaws, you might come to the conclusion that the crown of\nthe Swanscombe head was that of a modern-like man.\n\nTwo more skulls, again without faces, are available from a French\ncave site, Fontchevade. They come from the time of the last great\ninterglacial, as did the pre-neanderthaloids. The crowns of the\nFontchevade skulls also look quite modern. There is a bit of the\nforehead preserved on one of these skulls and the brow-ridge is not\nheavy. Nevertheless, there is a suggestion that the bones belonged to\nan immature individual. In this case, his (or even more so, if _her_)\nbrow-ridges would have been weak anyway. The case for the Fontchevade\nfossils, as modern type men, is little stronger than that for\nSwanscombe, although Professor Vallois believes it a good case.\n\nIt seems to add up to the fact that there were people living in\nEurope--before the classic neanderthaloids--who looked more modern,\nin some features, than the classic western neanderthaloids did. Our\nbest suggestion of what men looked like--just before they became fully\nmodern--comes from a cave on Mount Carmel in Palestine.\n\n\nTHE FIRST MODERNS\n\nProfessor T. D. McCown and the late Sir Arthur Keith, who studied the\nMount Carmel bones, figured out that one of the two groups involved\nwas as much as 70 per cent modern. There were, in fact, two groups or\nvarieties of men in the Mount Carmel caves and in at least two other\nPalestinian caves of about the same time. The time would be about that\nof the onset of colder weather, when the last glaciation was beginning\nin the north--say 75,000 years ago.\n\nThe 70 per cent modern group came from only one cave, Mugharet es-Skhul\n(cave of the kids). The other group, from several caves, had bones of\nmen of the type weve been calling pre-neanderthaloid which we noted\nwere widespread in Europe and beyond. The tools which came with each\nof these finds were generally similar, and McCown and Keith, and other\nscholars since their study, have tended to assume that both the Skhul\ngroup and the pre-neanderthaloid group came from exactly the same time.\nThe conclusion was quite natural: here was a population of men in the\nact of evolving in two different directions. But the time may not be\nexactly the same. It is very difficult to be precise, within say 10,000\nyears, for a time some 75,000 years ago. If the Skhul men are in fact\nlater than the pre-neanderthaloid group of Palestine, as some of us\nthink, then they show how relatively modern some men were--men who\nlived at the same time as the classic Neanderthalers of the European\npocket.\n\nSoon after the first extremely cold phase of the last glaciation, we\nbegin to get a number of bones of completely modern men in Europe.\nWe also get great numbers of the tools they made, and their living\nplaces in caves. Completely modern skeletons begin turning up in caves\ndating back to toward 40,000 years ago. The time is about that of the\nbeginning of the second phase of the last glaciation. These skeletons\nbelonged to people no different from many people we see today. Like\npeople today, not everybody looked alike. (The positions of the more\nimportant fossil men of later Europe are shown in the chart on page\n72.)\n\n\nDIFFERENCES IN THE EARLY MODERNS\n\nThe main early European moderns have been divided into two groups, the\nCro-Magnon group and the Combe Capelle-Brnn group. Cro-Magnon people\nwere tall and big-boned, with large, long, and rugged heads. They\nmust have been built like many present-day Scandinavians. The Combe\nCapelle-Brnn people were shorter; they had narrow heads and faces, and\nbig eyebrow-ridges. Of course we dont find the skin or hair of these\npeople. But there is little doubt they were Caucasoids (Whites).\n\nAnother important find came in the Italian Riviera, near Monte Carlo.\nHere, in a cave near Grimaldi, there was a grave containing a woman\nand a young boy, buried together. The two skeletons were first called\nNegroid because some features of their bones were thought to resemble\ncertain features of modern African Negro bones. But more recently,\nProfessor E. A. Hooton and other experts questioned the use of the word\nNegroid in describing the Grimaldi skeletons. It is true that nothing\nis known of the skin color, hair form, or any other fleshy feature of\nthe Grimaldi people, so that the word Negroid in its usual meaning is\nnot proper here. It is also not clear whether the features of the bones\nclaimed to be Negroid are really so at all.\n\nFrom a place called Wadjak, in Java, we have proto-Australoid skulls\nwhich closely resemble those of modern Australian natives. Some of\nthe skulls found in South Africa, especially the Boskop skull, look\nlike those of modern Bushmen, but are much bigger. The ancestors of\nthe Bushmen seem to have once been very widespread south of the Sahara\nDesert. True African Negroes were forest people who apparently expanded\nout of the west central African area only in the last several thousand\nyears. Although dark in skin color, neither the Australians nor the\nBushmen are Negroes; neither the Wadjak nor the Boskop skulls are\nNegroid.\n\nAs weve already mentioned, Professor Weidenreich believed that Peking\nman was already on the way to becoming a Mongoloid. Anyway, the\nMongoloids would seem to have been present by the time of the Upper\nCave at Choukoutien, the _Sinanthropus_ find-spot.\n\n\nWHAT THE DIFFERENCES MEAN\n\nWhat does all this difference mean? It means that, at one moment in\ntime, within each different area, men tended to look somewhat alike.\nFrom area to area, men tended to look somewhat different, just as\nthey do today. This is all quite natural. People _tended_ to mate\nnear home; in the anthropological jargon, they made up geographically\nlocalized breeding populations. The simple continental division of\nstocks--black = Africa, yellow = Asia, white = Europe--is too simple\na picture to fit the facts. People became accustomed to life in some\nparticular area within a continent (we might call it a natural area).\nAs they went on living there, they evolved towards some particular\nphysical variety. It would, of course, have been difficult to draw\na clear boundary between two adjacent areas. There must always have\nbeen some mating across the boundaries in every case. One thing human\nbeings dont do, and never have done, is to mate for purity. It is\nself-righteous nonsense when we try to kid ourselves into thinking that\nthey do.\n\nI am not going to struggle with the whole business of modern stocks and\nraces. This is a book about prehistoric men, not recent historic or\nmodern men. My physical anthropologist friends have been very patient\nin helping me to write and rewrite this chapter--I am not going to\nbreak their patience completely. Races are their business, not mine,\nand they must do the writing about races. I shall, however, give two\nmodern definitions of race, and then make one comment.\n\n  Dr. William G. Boyd, professor of Immunochemistry, School of\n    Medicine, Boston University: We may define a human race as a\n    population which differs significantly from other human populations\n    in regard to the frequency of one or more of the genes it\n    possesses.\n\n  Professor Sherwood L. Washburn, professor of Physical Anthropology,\n    Department of Anthropology, the University of California: A race\n    is a group of genetically similar populations, and races intergrade\n    because there are always intermediate populations.\n\nMy comment is that the ideas involved here are all biological: they\nconcern groups, _not_ individuals. Boyd and Washburn may differ a bit\non what they want to consider a population, but a population is a\ngroup nevertheless, and genetics is biology to the hilt. Now a lot of\npeople still think of race in terms of how people dress or fix their\nfood or of other habits or customs they have. The next step is to talk\nabout racial purity. None of this has anything whatever to do with\nrace proper, which is a matter of the biology of groups.\n\nIncidentally, Im told that if man very carefully _controls_\nthe breeding of certain animals over generations--dogs, cattle,\nchickens--he might achieve a pure race of animals. But he doesnt do\nit. Some unfortunate genetic trait soon turns up, so this has just as\ncarefully to be bred out again, and so on.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF FOSSIL MEN\n\nThe earliest bones of men we now have--upon which all the experts\nwould probably agree--are those of _Meganthropus_, from Java, of about\n450,000 years ago. The earlier australopithecines of Africa were\npossibly not tool-users and may not have been ancestral to men at all.\nBut there is an alternate and evidently increasingly stronger chance\nthat some of them may have been. The Kanam jaw from Kenya, another\nearly possibility, is not only very incomplete but its find-spot is\nvery questionable.\n\nJava man proper, _Pithecanthropus_, comes next, at about 400,000 years\nago, and the big Heidelberg jaw in Germany must be of about the same\ndate. Next comes Swanscombe in England, Steinheim in Germany, the\nTernafine jaws in Algeria, and Peking man, _Sinanthropus_. They all\ndate to the second great interglacial period, about 350,000 years ago.\n\nPiltdown and Galley Hill are out, and with them, much of the starch\nin the old idea that there were two distinct lines of development\nin human evolution: (1) a line of paleoanthropic development from\nHeidelberg to the Neanderthalers where it became extinct, and (2) a\nvery early modern line, through Piltdown, Galley Hill, Swanscombe, to\nus. Swanscombe, Steinheim, and Ternafine are just as easily cases of\nvery early pre-neanderthaloids.\n\nThe pre-neanderthaloids were very widespread during the third\ninterglacial: Ehringsdorf, Saccopastore, some of the Mount Carmel\npeople, and probably Fontchevade are cases in point. A variety of\ntheir descendants can be seen, from Java (Solo), Africa (Rhodesian\nman), and about the Mediterranean and in western Europe. As the acute\ncold of the last glaciation set in, the western Europeans found\nthemselves surrounded by water, ice, or bitter cold tundra. To vastly\nover-simplify it, they bred in and became classic neanderthaloids.\nBut on Mount Carmel, the Skhul cave-find with its 70 per cent modern\nfeatures shows what could happen elsewhere at the same time.\n\nLastly, from about 40,000 or 35,000 years ago--the time of the onset\nof the second phase of the last glaciation--we begin to find the fully\nmodern skeletons of men. The modern skeletons differ from place to\nplace, just as different groups of men living in different places still\nlook different.\n\nWhat became of the Neanderthalers? Nobody can tell me for sure. Ive a\nhunch they were simply bred out again when the cold weather was over.\nMany Americans, as the years go by, are no longer ashamed to claim they\nhave Indian blood in their veins. Give us a few more generations\nand there will not be very many other Americans left to whom we can\nbrag about it. It certainly isnt inconceivable to me to imagine a\nlittle Cro-Magnon boy bragging to his friends about his tough, strong,\nNeanderthaler great-great-great-great-grandfather!\n\n\n\n\nCultural BEGINNINGS\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nMen, unlike the lower animals, are made up of much more than flesh and\nblood and bones; for men have culture.\n\n\nWHAT IS CULTURE?\n\nCulture is a word with many meanings. The doctors speak of making a\nculture of a certain kind of bacteria, and ants are said to have a\nculture. Then there is the Emily Post kind of culture--you say a\nperson is cultured, or that he isnt, depending on such things as\nwhether or not he eats peas with his knife.\n\nThe anthropologists use the word too, and argue heatedly over its finer\nmeanings; but they all agree that every human being is part of or has\nsome kind of culture. Each particular human group has a particular\nculture; that is one of the ways in which we can tell one group of\nmen from another. In this sense, a CULTURE means the way the members\nof a group of people think and believe and live, the tools they make,\nand the way they do things. Professor Robert Redfield says a culture\nis an organized or formalized body of conventional understandings.\nConventional understandings means the whole set of rules, beliefs,\nand standards which a group of people lives by. These understandings\nshow themselves in art, and in the other things a people may make and\ndo. The understandings continue to last, through tradition, from one\ngeneration to another. They are what really characterize different\nhuman groups.\n\n\nSOME CHARACTERISTICS OF CULTURE\n\nA culture lasts, although individual men in the group die off. On\nthe other hand, a culture changes as the different conventions and\nunderstandings change. You could almost say that a culture lives in the\nminds of the men who have it. But people are not born with it; they\nget it as they grow up. Suppose a day-old Hungarian baby is adopted by\na family in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and the child is not told that he is\nHungarian. He will grow up with no more idea of Hungarian culture than\nanyone else in Oshkosh.\n\nSo when I speak of ancient Egyptian culture, I mean the whole body\nof understandings and beliefs and knowledge possessed by the ancient\nEgyptians. I mean their beliefs as to why grain grew, as well as their\nability to make tools with which to reap the grain. I mean their\nbeliefs about life after death. What I am thinking about as culture is\na thing which lasted in time. If any one Egyptian, even the Pharaoh,\ndied, it didnt affect the Egyptian culture of that particular moment.\n\n\nPREHISTORIC CULTURES\n\nFor that long period of mans history that is all prehistory, we have\nno written descriptions of cultures. We find only the tools men made,\nthe places where they lived, the graves in which they buried their\ndead. Fortunately for us, these tools and living places and graves all\ntell us something about the ways these men lived and the things they\nbelieved. But the story we learn of the very early cultures must be\nonly a very small part of the whole, for we find so few things. The\nrest of the story is gone forever. We have to do what we can with what\nwe find.\n\nFor all of the time up to about 75,000 years ago, which was the time\nof the classic European Neanderthal group of men, we have found few\ncave-dwelling places of very early prehistoric men. First, there is the\nfallen-in cave where Peking man was found, near Peking. Then there are\ntwo or three other _early_, but not _very early_, possibilities. The\nfinds at the base of the French cave of Fontchevade, those in one of\nthe Makapan caves in South Africa, and several open sites such as Dr.\nL. S. B. Leakeys Olorgesailie in Kenya doubtless all lie earlier than\nthe time of the main European Neanderthal group, but none are so early\nas the Peking finds.\n\nYou can see that we know very little about the home life of earlier\nprehistoric men. We find different kinds of early stone tools, but we\ncant even be really sure which tools may have been used together.\n\n\nWHY LITTLE HAS LASTED FROM EARLY TIMES\n\nExcept for the rare find-spots mentioned above, all our very early\nfinds come from geological deposits, or from the wind-blown surfaces\nof deserts. Here is what the business of geological deposits really\nmeans. Let us say that a group of people was living in England about\n300,000 years ago. They made the tools they needed, lived in some sort\nof camp, almost certainly built fires, and perhaps buried their dead.\nWhile the climate was still warm, many generations may have lived in\nthe same place, hunting, and gathering nuts and berries; but after some\nfew thousand years, the weather began very gradually to grow colder.\nThese early Englishmen would not have known that a glacier was forming\nover northern Europe. They would only have noticed that the animals\nthey hunted seemed to be moving south, and that the berries grew larger\ntoward the south. So they would have moved south, too.\n\nThe camp site they left is the place we archeologists would really have\nliked to find. All of the different tools the people used would have\nbeen there together--many broken, some whole. The graves, and traces\nof fire, and the tools would have been there. But the glacier got\nthere first! The front of this enormous sheet of ice moved down over\nthe country, crushing and breaking and plowing up everything, like a\ngigantic bulldozer. You can see what happened to our camp site.\n\nEverything the glacier couldnt break, it pushed along in front of it\nor plowed beneath it. Rocks were ground to gravel, and soil was caught\ninto the ice, which afterwards melted and ran off as muddy water. Hard\ntools of flint sometimes remained whole. Human bones werent so hard;\nits a wonder _any_ of them lasted. Gushing streams of melt water\nflushed out the debris from underneath the glacier, and water flowed\noff the surface and through great crevasses. The hard materials these\nwaters carried were even more rolled and ground up. Finally, such\nmaterials were dropped by the rushing waters as gravels, miles from\nthe front of the glacier. At last the glacier reached its greatest\nextent; then it melted backward toward the north. Debris held in the\nice was dropped where the ice melted, or was flushed off by more melt\nwater. When the glacier, leaving the land, had withdrawn to the sea,\ngreat hunks of ice were broken off as icebergs. These icebergs probably\ndropped the materials held in their ice wherever they floated and\nmelted. There must be many tools and fragmentary bones of prehistoric\nmen on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea.\n\nRemember, too, that these glaciers came and went at least three or four\ntimes during the Ice Age. Then you will realize why the earlier things\nwe find are all mixed up. Stone tools from one camp site got mixed up\nwith stone tools from many other camp sites--tools which may have been\nmade tens of thousands or more years apart. The glaciers mixed them\nall up, and so we cannot say which particular sets of tools belonged\ntogether in the first place.\n\n\nEOLITHS\n\nBut what sort of tools do we find earliest? For almost a century,\npeople have been picking up odd bits of flint and other stone in the\noldest Ice Age gravels in England and France. It is now thought these\nodd bits of stone werent actually worked by prehistoric men. The\nstones were given a name, _eoliths_, or dawn stones. You can see them\nin many museums; but you can be pretty sure that very few of them were\nactually fashioned by men.\n\nIt is impossible to pick out eoliths that seem to be made in any\none _tradition_. By tradition I mean a set of habits for making one\nkind of tool for some particular job. No two eoliths look very much\nalike: tools made as part of some one tradition all look much alike.\nNow its easy to suppose that the very earliest prehistoric men picked\nup and used almost any sort of stone. This wouldnt be surprising; you\nand I do it when we go camping. In other words, some of these eoliths\nmay actually have been used by prehistoric men. They must have used\nanything that might be handy when they needed it. We could have figured\nthat out without the eoliths.\n\n\nTHE ROAD TO STANDARDIZATION\n\nReasoning from what we know or can easily imagine, there should have\nbeen three major steps in the prehistory of tool-making. The first step\nwould have been simple _utilization_ of what was at hand. This is the\nstep into which the eoliths would fall. The second step would have\nbeen _fashioning_--the haphazard preparation of a tool when there was a\nneed for it. Probably many of the earlier pebble tools, which I shall\ndescribe next, fall into this group. The third step would have been\n_standardization_. Here, men began to make tools according to certain\nset traditions. Counting the better-made pebble tools, there are four\nsuch traditions or sets of habits for the production of stone tools in\nearliest prehistoric times. Toward the end of the Pleistocene, a fifth\ntradition appears.\n\n\nPEBBLE TOOLS\n\nAt the beginning of the last chapter, youll remember that I said there\nwere tools from very early geological beds. The earliest bones of men\nhave not yet been found in such early beds although the Sterkfontein\naustralopithecine cave approaches this early date. The earliest tools\ncome from Africa. They date back to the time of the first great\nalpine glaciation and are at least 500,000 years old. The earliest\nones are made of split pebbles, about the size of your fist or a bit\nbigger. They go under the name of pebble tools. There are many natural\nexposures of early Pleistocene geological beds in Africa, and the\nprehistoric archeologists of south and central Africa have concentrated\non searching for early tools. Other finds of early pebble tools have\nrecently been made in Algeria and Morocco.\n\n[Illustration: SOUTH AFRICAN PEBBLE TOOL]\n\nThere are probably early pebble tools to be found in areas of the\nOld World besides Africa; in fact, some prehistorians already claim\nto have identified a few. Since the forms and the distinct ways of\nmaking the earlier pebble tools had not yet sufficiently jelled into\na set tradition, they are difficult for us to recognize. It is not\nso difficult, however, if there are great numbers of possibles\navailable. A little later in time the tradition becomes more clearly\nset, and pebble tools are easier to recognize. So far, really large\ncollections of pebble tools have only been found and examined in Africa.\n\n\nCORE-BIFACE TOOLS\n\nThe next tradition well look at is the _core_ or biface one. The tools\nare large pear-shaped pieces of stone trimmed flat on the two opposite\nsides or faces. Hence biface has been used to describe these tools.\nThe front view is like that of a pear with a rather pointed top, and\nthe back view looks almost exactly the same. Look at them side on, and\nyou can see that the front and back faces are the same and have been\ntrimmed to a thin tip. The real purpose in trimming down the two faces\nwas to get a good cutting edge all around. You can see all this in the\nillustration.\n\n[Illustration: ABBEVILLIAN BIFACE]\n\nWe have very little idea of the way in which these core-bifaces were\nused. They have been called hand axes, but this probably gives the\nwrong idea, for an ax, to us, is not a pointed tool. All of these early\ntools must have been used for a number of jobs--chopping, scraping,\ncutting, hitting, picking, and prying. Since the core-bifaces tend to\nbe pointed, it seems likely that they were used for hitting, picking,\nand prying. But they have rough cutting edges, so they could have been\nused for chopping, scraping, and cutting.\n\n\nFLAKE TOOLS\n\nThe third tradition is the _flake_ tradition. The idea was to get a\ntool with a good cutting edge by simply knocking a nice large flake off\na big block of stone. You had to break off the flake in such a way that\nit was broad and thin, and also had a good sharp cutting edge. Once you\nreally got on to the trick of doing it, this was probably a simpler way\nto make a good cutting tool than preparing a biface. You have to know\nhow, though; Ive tried it and have mashed my fingers more than once.\n\nThe flake tools look as if they were meant mainly for chopping,\nscraping, and cutting jobs. When one made a flake tool, the idea seems\nto have been to produce a broad, sharp, cutting edge.\n\n[Illustration: CLACTONIAN FLAKE]\n\nThe core-biface and the flake traditions were spread, from earliest\ntimes, over much of Europe, Africa, and western Asia. The map on page\n52 shows the general area. Over much of this great region there was\nflint. Both of these traditions seem well adapted to flint, although\ngood core-bifaces and flakes were made from other kinds of stone,\nespecially in Africa south of the Sahara.\n\n\nCHOPPERS AND ADZE-LIKE TOOLS\n\nThe fourth early tradition is found in southern and eastern Asia, from\nnorthwestern India through Java and Burma into China. Father Maringer\nrecently reported an early group of tools in Japan, which most resemble\nthose of Java, called Patjitanian. The prehistoric men in this general\narea mostly used quartz and tuff and even petrified wood for their\nstone tools (see illustration, p. 46).\n\nThis fourth early tradition is called the _chopper-chopping tool_\ntradition. It probably has its earliest roots in the pebble tool\ntradition of African type. There are several kinds of tools in this\ntradition, but all differ from the western core-bifaces and flakes.\nThere are broad, heavy scrapers or cleavers, and tools with an\nadze-like cutting edge. These last-named tools are called hand adzes,\njust as the core-bifaces of the west have often been called hand\naxes. The section of an adze cutting edge is ? shaped; the section of\nan ax is < shaped.\n\n[Illustration: ANYATHIAN ADZE-LIKE TOOL]\n\nThere are also pointed pebble tools. Thus the tool kit of these early\nsouth and east Asiatic peoples seems to have included tools for doing\nas many different jobs as did the tools of the Western traditions.\n\nDr. H. L. Movius has emphasized that the tools which were found in the\nPeking cave with Peking man belong to the chopper-tool tradition. This\nis the only case as yet where the tools and the man have been found\ntogether from very earliest times--if we except Sterkfontein.\n\n\nDIFFERENCES WITHIN THE TOOL-MAKING TRADITIONS\n\nThe latter three great traditions in the manufacture of stone\ntools--and the less clear-cut pebble tools before them--are all we have\nto show of the cultures of the men of those times. Changes happened in\neach of the traditions. As time went on, the tools in each tradition\nwere better made. There could also be slight regional differences in\nthe tools within one tradition. Thus, tools with small differences, but\nall belonging to one tradition, can be given special group (facies)\nnames.\n\nThis naming of special groups has been going on for some time. Here are\nsome of these names, since you may see them used in museum displays\nof flint tools, or in books. Within each tradition of tool-making\n(save the chopper tools), the earliest tool type is at the bottom\nof the list, just as it appears in the lowest beds of a geological\nstratification.[3]\n\n  [3] Archeologists usually make their charts and lists with the\n      earliest materials at the bottom and the latest on top, since\n      this is the way they find them in the ground.\n\n  Chopper tool (all about equally early):\n    Anyathian (Burma)\n    Choukoutienian (China)\n    Patjitanian (Java)\n    Soan (India)\n\n  Flake:\n    Typical Mousterian\n    Levalloiso-Mousterian\n    Levalloisian\n    Tayacian\n    Clactonian (localized in England)\n\n  Core-biface:\n    Some blended elements in Mousterian\n    Micoquian (= Acheulean 6 and 7)\n    Acheulean\n    Abbevillian (once called Chellean)\n\n  Pebble tool:\n    Oldowan\n    Ain Hanech\n    pre-Stellenbosch\n    Kafuan\n\nThe core-biface and the flake traditions appear in the chart (p. 65).\n\nThe early archeologists had many of the tool groups named before they\never realized that there were broader tool preparation traditions. This\nwas understandable, for in dealing with the mixture of things that come\nout of glacial gravels the easiest thing to do first is to isolate\nindividual types of tools into groups. First you put a bushel-basketful\nof tools on a table and begin matching up types. Then you give names to\nthe groups of each type. The groups and the types are really matters of\nthe archeologists choice; in real life, they were probably less exact\nthan the archeologists lists of them. We now know pretty well in which\nof the early traditions the various early groups belong.\n\n\nTHE MEANING OF THE DIFFERENT TRADITIONS\n\nWhat do the traditions really mean? I see them as the standardization\nof ways to make tools for particular jobs. We may not know exactly what\njob the maker of a particular core-biface or flake tool had in mind. We\ncan easily see, however, that he already enjoyed a know-how, a set of\npersistent habits of tool preparation, which would always give him the\nsame type of tool when he wanted to make it. Therefore, the traditions\nshow us that persistent habits already existed for the preparation of\none type of tool or another.\n\nThis tells us that one of the characteristic aspects of human culture\nwas already present. There must have been, in the minds of these\nearly men, a notion of the ideal type of tool for a particular job.\nFurthermore, since we find so many thousands upon thousands of tools\nof one type or another, the notion of the ideal types of tools _and_\nthe know-how for the making of each type must have been held in common\nby many men. The notions of the ideal types and the know-how for their\nproduction must have been passed on from one generation to another.\n\nI could even guess that the notions of the ideal type of one or the\nother of these tools stood out in the minds of men of those times\nsomewhat like a symbol of perfect tool for good job. If this were\nso--remember its only a wild guess of mine--then men were already\nsymbol users. Now lets go on a further step to the fact that the words\nmen speak are simply sounds, each different sound being a symbol for a\ndifferent meaning. If standardized tool-making suggests symbol-making,\nis it also possible that crude word-symbols were also being made? I\nsuppose that it is not impossible.\n\nThere may, of course, be a real question whether tool-utilizing\ncreatures--our first step, on page 42--were actually men. Other\nanimals utilize things at hand as tools. The tool-fashioning creature\nof our second step is more suggestive, although we may not yet feel\nsure that many of the earlier pebble tools were man-made products. But\nwith the step to standardization and the appearance of the traditions,\nI believe we must surely be dealing with the traces of culture-bearing\n_men_. The conventional understandings which Professor Redfields\ndefinition of culture suggests are now evidenced for us in the\npersistent habits for the preparation of stone tools. Were we able to\nsee the other things these prehistoric men must have made--in materials\nno longer preserved for the archeologist to find--I believe there would\nbe clear signs of further conventional understandings. The men may have\nbeen physically primitive and pretty shaggy in appearance, but I think\nwe must surely call them men.\n\n\nAN OLDER INTERPRETATION OF THE WESTERN TRADITIONS\n\nIn the last chapter, I told you that many of the older archeologists\nand human paleontologists used to think that modern man was very old.\nThe supposed ages of Piltdown and Galley Hill were given as evidence\nof the great age of anatomically modern man, and some interpretations\nof the Swanscombe and Fontchevade fossils were taken to support\nthis view. The conclusion was that there were two parallel lines or\nphyla of men already present well back in the Pleistocene. The\nfirst of these, the more primitive or paleoanthropic line, was\nsaid to include Heidelberg, the proto-neanderthaloids and classic\nNeanderthal. The more anatomically modern or neanthropic line was\nthought to consist of Piltdown and the others mentioned above. The\nNeanderthaler or paleoanthropic line was thought to have become extinct\nafter the first phase of the last great glaciation. Of course, the\nmodern or neanthropic line was believed to have persisted into the\npresent, as the basis for the worlds population today. But with\nPiltdown liquidated, Galley Hill known to be very late, and Swanscombe\nand Fontchevade otherwise interpreted, there is little left of the\nso-called parallel phyla theory.\n\nWhile the theory was in vogue, however, and as long as the European\narcheological evidence was looked at in one short-sighted way, the\narcheological materials _seemed_ to fit the parallel phyla theory. It\nwas simply necessary to believe that the flake tools were made only\nby the paleoanthropic Neanderthaler line, and that the more handsome\ncore-biface tools were the product of the neanthropic modern-man line.\n\nRemember that _almost_ all of the early prehistoric European tools\ncame only from the redeposited gravel beds. This means that the tools\nwere not normally found in the remains of camp sites or work shops\nwhere they had actually been dropped by the men who made and used\nthem. The tools came, rather, from the secondary hodge-podge of the\nglacial gravels. I tried to give you a picture of the bulldozing action\nof glaciers (p. 40) and of the erosion and weathering that were\nside-effects of a glacially conditioned climate on the earths surface.\nAs we said above, if one simply plucks tools out of the redeposited\ngravels, his natural tendency is to type the tools by groups, and to\nthink that the groups stand for something _on their own_.\n\nIn 1906, M. Victor Commont actually made a rare find of what seems\nto have been a kind of workshop site, on a terrace above the Somme\nriver in France. Here, Commont realized, flake tools appeared clearly\nin direct association with core-biface tools. Few prehistorians paid\nattention to Commont or his site, however. It was easier to believe\nthat flake tools represented a distinct culture and that this\nculture was that of the Neanderthaler or paleoanthropic line, and\nthat the core-bifaces stood for another culture which was that of the\nsupposed early modern or neanthropic line. Of course, I am obviously\nskipping many details here. Some later sites with Neanderthal fossils\ndo seem to have only flake tools, but other such sites have both types\nof tools. The flake tools which appeared _with_ the core-bifaces\nin the Swanscombe gravels were never made much of, although it\nwas embarrassing for the parallel phyla people that Fontchevade\nran heavily to flake tools. All in all, the parallel phyla theory\nflourished because it seemed so neat and easy to understand.\n\n\nTRADITIONS ARE TOOL-MAKING HABITS, NOT CULTURES\n\nIn case you think I simply enjoy beating a dead horse, look in any\nstandard book on prehistory written twenty (or even ten) years ago, or\nin most encyclopedias. Youll find that each of the individual tool\ntypes, of the West, at least, was supposed to represent a culture.\nThe cultures were believed to correspond to parallel lines of human\nevolution.\n\nIn 1937, Mr. Harper Kelley strongly re-emphasized the importance\nof Commonts workshop site and the presence of flake tools with\ncore-bifaces. Next followed Dr. Movius clear delineation of the\nchopper-chopping tool tradition of the Far East. This spoiled the nice\nsymmetry of the flake-tool = paleoanthropic, core-biface = neanthropic\nequations. Then came increasing understanding of the importance of\nthe pebble tools in Africa, and the location of several more workshop\nsites there, especially at Olorgesailie in Kenya. Finally came the\nliquidation of Piltdown and the deflation of Galley Hills date. So it\nis at last possible to picture an individual prehistoric man making a\nflake tool to do one job and a core-biface tool to do another. Commont\nshowed us this picture in 1906, but few believed him.\n\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF TOOL-PREPARATION TRADITIONS\n\nTime approximately 100,000 years ago]\n\nThere are certainly a few cases in which flake tools did appear with\nfew or no core-bifaces. The flake-tool group called Clactonian in\nEngland is such a case. Another good, but certainly later case is\nthat of the cave on Mount Carmel in Palestine, where the blended\npre-neanderthaloid, 70 per cent modern-type skulls were found. Here, in\nthe same level with the skulls, were 9,784 flint tools. Of these, only\nthree--doubtless strays--were core-bifaces; all the rest were flake\ntools or flake chips. We noted above how the Fontchevade cave ran to\nflake tools. The only conclusion I would draw from this is that times\nand circumstances did exist in which prehistoric men needed only flake\ntools. So they only made flake tools for those particular times and\ncircumstances.\n\n\nLIFE IN EARLIEST TIMES\n\nWhat do we actually know of life in these earliest times? In the\nglacial gravels, or in the terrace gravels of rivers once swollen by\nfloods of melt water or heavy rains, or on the windswept deserts, we\nfind stone tools. The earliest and coarsest of these are the pebble\ntools. We do not yet know what the men who made them looked like,\nalthough the Sterkfontein australopithecines probably give us a good\nhint. Then begin the more formal tool preparation traditions of the\nwest--the core-bifaces and the flake tools--and the chopper-chopping\ntool series of the farther east. There is an occasional roughly worked\npiece of bone. From the gravels which yield the Clactonian flakes of\nEngland comes the fire-hardened point of a wooden spear. There are\nalso the chance finds of the fossil human bones themselves, of which\nwe spoke in the last chapter. Aside from the cave of Peking man, none\nof the earliest tools have been found in caves. Open air or workshop\nsites which do not seem to have been disturbed later by some geological\nagency are very rare.\n\nThe chart on page 65 shows graphically what the situation in\nwest-central Europe seems to have been. It is not yet certain whether\nthere were pebble tools there or not. The Fontchevade cave comes\ninto the picture about 100,000 years ago or more. But for the earlier\nhundreds of thousands of years--below the red-dotted line on the\nchart--the tools we find come almost entirely from the haphazard\nmixture within the geological contexts.\n\nThe stone tools of each of the earlier traditions are the simplest\nkinds of all-purpose tools. Almost any one of them could be used for\nhacking, chopping, cutting, and scraping; so the men who used them must\nhave been living in a rough and ready sort of way. They found or hunted\ntheir food wherever they could. In the anthropological jargon, they\nwere food-gatherers, pure and simple.\n\nBecause of the mixture in the gravels and in the materials they\ncarried, we cant be sure which animals these men hunted. Bones of\nthe larger animals turn up in the gravels, but they could just as\nwell belong to the animals who hunted the men, rather than the other\nway about. We dont know. This is why camp sites like Commonts and\nOlorgesailie in Kenya are so important when we do find them. The animal\nbones at Olorgesailie belonged to various mammals of extremely large\nsize. Probably they were taken in pit-traps, but there are a number of\ngroups of three round stones on the site which suggest that the people\nused bolas. The South American Indians used three-ball bolas, with the\nstones in separate leather bags connected by thongs. These were whirled\nand then thrown through the air so as to entangle the feet of a fleeing\nanimal.\n\nProfessor F. Clark Howell recently returned from excavating another\nimportant open air site at Isimila in Tanganyika. The site yielded\nthe bones of many fossil animals and also thousands of core-bifaces,\nflakes, and choppers. But Howells reconstruction of the food-getting\nhabits of the Isimila people certainly suggests that the word hunting\nis too dignified for what they did; scavenging would be much nearer\nthe mark.\n\nDuring a great part of this time the climate was warm and pleasant. The\nsecond interglacial period (the time between the second and third great\nalpine glaciations) lasted a long time, and during much of this time\nthe climate may have been even better than ours is now. We dont know\nthat earlier prehistoric men in Europe or Africa lived in caves. They\nmay not have needed to; much of the weather may have been so nice that\nthey lived in the open. Perhaps they didnt wear clothes, either.\n\n\nWHAT THE PEKING CAVE-FINDS TELL US\n\nThe one early cave-dwelling we have found is that of Peking man, in\nChina. Peking man had fire. He probably cooked his meat, or used\nthe fire to keep dangerous animals away from his den. In the cave\nwere bones of dangerous animals, members of the wolf, bear, and cat\nfamilies. Some of the cat bones belonged to beasts larger than tigers.\nThere were also bones of other wild animals: buffalo, camel, deer,\nelephants, horses, sheep, and even ostriches. Seventy per cent of the\nanimals Peking man killed were fallow deer. Its much too cold and dry\nin north China for all these animals to live there today. So this list\nhelps us know that the weather was reasonably warm, and that there was\nenough rain to grow grass for the grazing animals. The list also helps\nthe paleontologists to date the find.\n\nPeking man also seems to have eaten plant food, for there are hackberry\nseeds in the debris of the cave. His tools were made of sandstone and\nquartz and sometimes of a rather bad flint. As weve already seen, they\nbelong in the chopper-tool tradition. It seems fairly clear that some\nof the edges were chipped by right-handed people. There are also many\nsplit pieces of heavy bone. Peking man probably split them so he could\neat the bone marrow, but he may have used some of them as tools.\n\nMany of these split bones were the bones of Peking men. Each one of the\nskulls had already had the base broken out of it. In no case were any\nof the bones resting together in their natural relation to one another.\nThere is nothing like a burial; all of the bones are scattered. Now\nits true that animals could have scattered bodies that were not cared\nfor or buried. But splitting bones lengthwise and carefully removing\nthe base of a skull call for both the tools and the people to use them.\nIts pretty clear who the people were. Peking man was a cannibal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis rounds out about all we can say of the life and times of early\nprehistoric men. In those days life was rough. You evidently had to\nwatch out not only for dangerous animals but also for your fellow men.\nYou ate whatever you could catch or find growing. But you had sense\nenough to build fires, and you had already formed certain habits for\nmaking the kinds of stone tools you needed. Thats about all we know.\nBut I think well have to admit that cultural beginnings had been made,\nand that these early people were really _men_.\n\n\n\n\nMORE EVIDENCE of Culture\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nWhile the dating is not yet sure, the material that we get from caves\nin Europe must go back to about 100,000 years ago; the time of the\nclassic Neanderthal group followed soon afterwards. We dont know why\nthere is no earlier material in the caves; apparently they were not\nused before the last interglacial phase (the period just before the\nlast great glaciation). We know that men of the classic Neanderthal\ngroup were living in caves from about 75,000 to 45,000 years ago.\nNew radioactive carbon dates even suggest that some of the traces of\nculture well describe in this chapter may have lasted to about 35,000\nyears ago. Probably some of the pre-neanderthaloid types of men had\nalso lived in caves. But we have so far found their bones in caves only\nin Palestine and at Fontchevade.\n\n\nTHE CAVE LAYERS\n\nIn parts of France, some peasants still live in caves. In prehistoric\ntime, many generations of people lived in them. As a result, many\ncaves have deep layers of debris. The first people moved in and lived\non the rock floor. They threw on the floor whatever they didnt want,\nand they tracked in mud; nobody bothered to clean house in those days.\nTheir debris--junk and mud and garbage and what not--became packed\ninto a layer. As time went on, and generations passed, the layer grew\nthicker. Then there might have been a break in the occupation of the\ncave for a while. Perhaps the game animals got scarce and the people\nmoved away; or maybe the cave became flooded. Later on, other people\nmoved in and began making a new layer of their own on top of the first\nlayer. Perhaps this process of layering went on in the same cave for a\nhundred thousand years; you can see what happened. The drawing on this\npage shows a section through such a cave. The earliest layer is on the\nbottom, the latest one on top. They go in order from bottom to top,\nearliest to latest. This is the _stratification_ we talked about (p.\n12).\n\n[Illustration: SECTION OF SHELTER ON LOWER TERRACE, LE MOUSTIER]\n\nWhile we may find a mix-up in caves, its not nearly as bad as the\nmixing up that was done by glaciers. The animal bones and shells, the\nfireplaces, the bones of men, and the tools the men made all belong\ntogether, if they come from one layer. Thats the reason why the cave\nof Peking man is so important. It is also the reason why the caves in\nEurope and the Near East are so important. We can get an idea of which\nthings belong together and which lot came earliest and which latest.\n\nIn most cases, prehistoric men lived only in the mouths of caves.\nThey didnt like the dark inner chambers as places to live in. They\npreferred rock-shelters, at the bases of overhanging cliffs, if there\nwas enough overhang to give shelter. When the weather was good, they no\ndoubt lived in the open air as well. Ill go on using the term cave\nsince its more familiar, but remember that I really mean rock-shelter,\nas a place in which people actually lived.\n\nThe most important European cave sites are in Spain, France, and\ncentral Europe; there are also sites in England and Italy. A few caves\nare known in the Near East and Africa, and no doubt more sites will be\nfound when the out-of-the-way parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia are\nstudied.\n\n\nAN INDUSTRY DEFINED\n\nWe have already seen that the earliest European cave materials are\nthose from the cave of Fontchevade. Movius feels certain that the\nlowest materials here date back well into the third interglacial stage,\nthat which lay between the Riss (next to the last) and the Wrm I\n(first stage of the last) alpine glaciations. This material consists\nof an _industry_ of stone tools, apparently all made in the flake\ntradition. This is the first time we have used the word industry.\nIt is useful to call all of the different tools found together in one\nlayer and made of _one kind of material_ an industry; that is, the\ntools must be found together as men left them. Tools taken from the\nglacial gravels (or from windswept desert surfaces or river gravels\nor any geological deposit) are not together in this sense. We might\nsay the latter have only geological, not archeological context.\nArcheological context means finding things just as men left them. We\ncan tell what tools go together in an industrial sense only if we\nhave archeological context.\n\nUp to now, the only things we could have called industries were the\nworked stone industry and perhaps the worked (?) bone industry of the\nPeking cave. We could add some of the very clear cases of open air\nsites, like Olorgesailie. We couldnt use the term for the stone tools\nfrom the glacial gravels, because we do not know which tools belonged\ntogether. But when the cave materials begin to appear in Europe, we can\nbegin to speak of industries. Most of the European caves of this time\ncontain industries of flint tools alone.\n\n\nTHE EARLIEST EUROPEAN CAVE LAYERS\n\nWeve just mentioned the industry from what is said to be the oldest\ninhabited cave in Europe; that is, the industry from the deepest layer\nof the site at Fontchevade. Apparently it doesnt amount to much. The\ntools are made of stone, in the flake tradition, and are very poorly\nworked. This industry is called _Tayacian_. Its type tool seems to be\na smallish flake tool, but there are also larger flakes which seem to\nhave been fashioned for hacking. In fact, the type tool seems to be\nsimply a smaller edition of the Clactonian tool (pictured on p. 45).\n\nNone of the Fontchevade tools are really good. There are scrapers,\nand more or less pointed tools, and tools that may have been used\nfor hacking and chopping. Many of the tools from the earlier glacial\ngravels are better made than those of this first industry we see in\na European cave. There is so little of this material available that\nwe do not know which is really typical and which is not. You would\nprobably find it hard to see much difference between this industry and\na collection of tools of the type called Clactonian, taken from the\nglacial gravels, especially if the Clactonian tools were small-sized.\n\nThe stone industry of the bottommost layer of the Mount Carmel cave,\nin Palestine, where somewhat similar tools were found, has also been\ncalled Tayacian.\n\nI shall have to bring in many unfamiliar words for the names of the\nindustries. The industries are usually named after the places where\nthey were first found, and since these were in most cases in France,\nmost of the names which follow will be of French origin. However,\nthe names have simply become handles and are in use far beyond the\nboundaries of France. It would be better if we had a non-place-name\nterminology, but archeologists have not yet been able to agree on such\na terminology.\n\n\nTHE ACHEULEAN INDUSTRY\n\nBoth in France and in Palestine, as well as in some African cave\nsites, the next layers in the deep caves have an industry in both the\ncore-biface and the flake traditions. The core-biface tools usually\nmake up less than half of all the tools in the industry. However,\nthe name of the biface type of tool is generally given to the whole\nindustry. It is called the _Acheulean_, actually a late form of it, as\nAcheulean is also used for earlier core-biface tools taken from the\nglacial gravels. In western Europe, the name used is _Upper Acheulean_\nor _Micoquian_. The same terms have been borrowed to name layers E and\nF in the Tabun cave, on Mount Carmel in Palestine.\n\nThe Acheulean core-biface type of tool is worked on two faces so as\nto give a cutting edge all around. The outline of its front view may\nbe oval, or egg-shaped, or a quite pointed pear shape. The large\nchip-scars of the Acheulean core-bifaces are shallow and flat. It is\nsuspected that this resulted from the removal of the chips with a\nwooden club; the deep chip-scars of the earlier Abbevillian core-biface\ncame from beating the tool against a stone anvil. These tools are\nreally the best and also the final products of the core-biface\ntradition. We first noticed the tradition in the early glacial gravels\n(p. 43); now we see its end, but also its finest examples, in the\ndeeper cave levels.\n\nThe flake tools, which really make up the greater bulk of this\nindustry, are simple scrapers and chips with sharp cutting edges. The\nhabits used to prepare them must have been pretty much the same as\nthose used for at least one of the flake industries we shall mention\npresently.\n\nThere is very little else in these early cave layers. We do not have\na proper industry of bone tools. There are traces of fire, and of\nanimal bones, and a few shells. In Palestine, there are many more\nbones of deer than of gazelle in these layers; the deer lives in a\nwetter climate than does the gazelle. In the European cave layers, the\nanimal bones are those of beasts that live in a warm climate. They\nbelonged in the last interglacial period. We have not yet found the\nbones of fossil men definitely in place with this industry.\n\n[Illustration: ACHEULEAN BIFACE]\n\n\nFLAKE INDUSTRIES FROM THE CAVES\n\nTwo more stone industries--the _Levalloisian_ and the\n_Mousterian_--turn up at approximately the same time in the European\ncave layers. Their tools seem to be mainly in the flake tradition,\nbut according to some of the authorities their preparation also shows\nsome combination with the habits by which the core-biface tools were\nprepared.\n\nNow notice that I dont tell you the Levalloisian and the Mousterian\nlayers are both above the late Acheulean layers. Look at the cave\nsection (p. 57) and youll find that some Mousterian of Acheulean\ntradition appears above some typical Mousterian. This means that\nthere may be some kinds of Acheulean industries that are later than\nsome kinds of Mousterian. The same is true of the Levalloisian.\n\nThere were now several different kinds of habits that men used in\nmaking stone tools. These habits were based on either one or the other\nof the two traditions--core-biface or flake--or on combinations of\nthe habits used in the preparation techniques of both traditions. All\nwere popular at about the same time. So we find that people who made\none kind of stone tool industry lived in a cave for a while. Then they\ngave up the cave for some reason, and people with another industry\nmoved in. Then the first people came back--or at least somebody with\nthe same tool-making habits as the first people. Or maybe a third group\nof tool-makers moved in. The people who had these different habits for\nmaking their stone tools seem to have moved around a good deal. They no\ndoubt borrowed and exchanged tricks of the trade with each other. There\nwere no patent laws in those days.\n\nThe extremely complicated interrelationships of the different habits\nused by the tool-makers of this range of time are at last being\nsystematically studied.

Franois Bordes has developed a statistical\nmethod of great importance for understanding these tool preparation\nhabits.\n\n\nTHE LEVALLOISIAN AND MOUSTERIAN\n\nThe easiest Levalloisian tool to spot is a big flake tool. The trick\nin making it was to fashion carefully a big chunk of stone (called\nthe Levalloisian tortoise core, because it resembles the shape of\na turtle-shell) and then to whack this in such a way that a large\nflake flew off. This large thin flake, with sharp cutting edges, is\nthe finished Levalloisian tool. There were various other tools in a\nLevalloisian industry, but this is the characteristic _Levalloisian_\ntool.\n\nThere are several typical Mousterian stone tools. Different from\nthe tools of the Levalloisian type, these were made from disc-like\ncores. There are medium-sized flake side scrapers. There are also\nsome small pointed tools and some small hand axes. The last of these\ntool types is often a flake worked on both of the flat sides (that\nis, bifacially). There are also pieces of flint worked into the form\nof crude balls. The pointed tools may have been fixed on shafts to\nmake short jabbing spears; the round flint balls may have been used as\nbolas. Actually, we dont _know_ what either tool was used for. The\npoints and side scrapers are illustrated (pp. 64 and 66).\n\n[Illustration: LEVALLOIS FLAKE]\n\n\nTHE MIXING OF TRADITIONS\n\nNowadays the archeologists are less and less sure of the importance\nof any one specific tool type and name. Twenty years ago, they used\nto speak simply of Acheulean or Levalloisian or Mousterian tools.\nNow, more and more, _all_ of the tools from some one layer in a\ncave are called an industry, which is given a mixed name. Thus we\nhave Levalloiso-Mousterian, and Acheuleo-Levalloisian, and even\nAcheuleo-Mousterian (or Mousterian of Acheulean tradition). Bordes\nsystematic work is beginning to clear up some of our confusion.\n\nThe time of these late Acheuleo-Levalloiso-Mousterioid industries\nis from perhaps as early as 100,000 years ago. It may have lasted\nuntil well past 50,000 years ago. This was the time of the first\nphase of the last great glaciation. It was also the time that the\nclassic group of Neanderthal men was living in Europe. A number of\nthe Neanderthal fossil finds come from these cave layers. Before the\ndifferent habits of tool preparation were understood it used to be\npopular to say Neanderthal man was Mousterian man. I think this is\nwrong. What used to be called Mousterian is now known to be a variety\nof industries with tools of both core-biface and flake habits, and\nso mixed that the word Mousterian used alone really doesnt mean\nanything. The Neanderthalers doubtless understood the tool preparation\nhabits by means of which Acheulean, Levalloisian and Mousterian type\ntools were produced. We also have the more modern-like Mount Carmel\npeople, found in a cave layer of Palestine with tools almost entirely\nin the flake tradition, called Levalloiso-Mousterian, and the\nFontchevade-Tayacian (p. 59).\n\n[Illustration: MOUSTERIAN POINT]\n\n\nOTHER SUGGESTIONS OF LIFE IN THE EARLY CAVE LAYERS\n\nExcept for the stone tools, what do we know of the way men lived in the\ntime range after 100,000 to perhaps 40,000 years ago or even later?\nWe know that in the area from Europe to Palestine, at least some of\nthe people (some of the time) lived in the fronts of caves and warmed\nthemselves over fires. In Europe, in the cave layers of these times,\nwe find the bones of different animals; the bones in the lowest layers\nbelong to animals that lived in a warm climate; above them are the\nbones of those who could stand the cold, like the reindeer and mammoth.\nThus, the meat diet must have been changing, as the glacier crept\nfarther south. Shells and possibly fish bones have lasted in these\ncave layers, but there is not a trace of the vegetable foods and the\nnuts and berries and other wild fruits that must have been eaten when\nthey could be found.\n\n[Illustration: CHART SHOWING PRESENT UNDERSTANDING OF RELATIONSHIPS AND\nSUCCESSION OF TOOL-PREPARATION TRADITIONS, INDUSTRIES, AND ASSEMBLAGES\nOF WEST-CENTRAL EUROPE\n\nWavy lines indicate transitions in industrial habits. These transitions\nare not yet understood in detail. The glacial and climatic scheme shown\nis the alpine one.]\n\nBone tools have also been found from this period. Some are called\nscrapers, and there are also long chisel-like leg-bone fragments\nbelieved to have been used for skinning animals. Larger hunks of bone,\nwhich seem to have served as anvils or chopping blocks, are fairly\ncommon.\n\nBits of mineral, used as coloring matter, have also been found. We\ndont know what the color was used for.\n\n[Illustration: MOUSTERIAN SIDE SCRAPER]\n\nThere is a small but certain number of cases of intentional burials.\nThese burials have been found on the floors of the caves; in other\nwords, the people dug graves in the places where they lived. The holes\nmade for the graves were small. For this reason (or perhaps for some\nother?) the bodies were in a curled-up or contracted position. Flint or\nbone tools or pieces of meat seem to have been put in with some of the\nbodies. In several cases, flat stones had been laid over the graves.\n\n\nTOOLS FROM AFRICA AND ASIA ABOUT 100,000 YEARS AGO\n\nProfessor Movius characterizes early prehistoric Africa as a continent\nshowing a variety of stone industries. Some of these industries were\npurely local developments and some were practically identical with\nindustries found in Europe at the same time. From northwest Africa\nto Capetown--excepting the tropical rain forest region of the west\ncenter--tools of developed Acheulean, Levalloisian, and Mousterian\ntypes have been recognized. Often they are named after African place\nnames.\n\nIn east and south Africa lived people whose industries show a\ndevelopment of the Levalloisian technique. Such industries are\ncalled Stillbay. Another industry, developed on the basis of the\nAcheulean technique, is called Fauresmith. From the northwest comes\nan industry with tanged points and flake-blades; this is called the\nAterian. The tropical rain forest region contained people whose stone\ntools apparently show adjustment to this peculiar environment; the\nso-called Sangoan industry includes stone picks, adzes, core-bifaces\nof specialized Acheulean type, and bifacial points which were probably\nspearheads.\n\nIn western Asia, even as far as the east coast of India, the tools of\nthe Eurafrican core-biface and flake tool traditions continued to be\nused. But in the Far East, as we noted in the last chapter, men had\ndeveloped characteristic stone chopper and chopping tools. This tool\npreparation tradition--basically a pebble tool tradition--lasted to the\nvery end of the Ice Age.\n\nWhen more intact open air sites such as that of an earlier time at\nOlorgesailie, and more stratified cave sites are found and excavated\nin Asia and Africa, we shall be able to get a more complete picture.\nSo far, our picture of the general cultural level of the Old World at\nabout 100,000 years ago--and soon afterwards--is best from Europe, but\nit is still far from complete there, too.\n\n\nCULTURE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST GREAT GLACIAL PERIOD\n\nThe few things we have found must indicate only a very small part\nof the total activities of the people who lived at the time. All of\nthe things they made of wood and bark, of skins, of anything soft,\nare gone. The fact that burials were made, at least in Europe and\nPalestine, is pretty clear proof that the people had some notion of a\nlife after death. But what this notion really was, or what gods (if\nany) men believed in, we cannot know. Dr. Movius has also reminded me\nof the so-called bear cults--cases in which caves have been found which\ncontain the skulls of bears in apparently purposeful arrangement. This\nmight suggest some notion of hoarding up the spirits or the strength of\nbears killed in the hunt. Probably the people lived in small groups,\nas hunting and food-gathering seldom provide enough food for large\ngroups of people. These groups probably had some kind of leader or\nchief. Very likely the rude beginnings of rules for community life\nand politics, and even law, were being made. But what these were, we\ndo not know. We can only guess about such things, as we can only guess\nabout many others; for example, how the idea of a family must have been\ngrowing, and how there may have been witch doctors who made beginnings\nin medicine or in art, in the materials they gathered for their trade.\n\nThe stone tools help us most. They have lasted, and we can find\nthem. As they come to us, from this cave or that, and from this\nlayer or that, the tool industries show a variety of combinations\nof the different basic habits or traditions of tool preparation.\nThis seems only natural, as the groups of people must have been very\nsmall. The mixtures and blendings of the habits used in making stone\ntools must mean that there were also mixtures and blends in many of\nthe other ideas and beliefs of these small groups. And what this\nprobably means is that there was no one _culture_ of the time. It is\ncertainly unlikely that there were simply three cultures, Acheulean,\nLevalloisian, and Mousterian, as has been thought in the past.\nRather there must have been a great variety of loosely related cultures\nat about the same stage of advancement. We could say, too, that here\nwe really begin to see, for the first time, that remarkable ability\nof men to adapt themselves to a variety of conditions. We shall see\nthis adaptive ability even more clearly as time goes on and the record\nbecomes more complete.\n\nOver how great an area did these loosely related cultures reach in\nthe time 75,000 to 45,000 or even as late as 35,000 years ago? We\nhave described stone tools made in one or another of the flake and\ncore-biface habits, for an enormous area. It covers all of Europe, all\nof Africa, the Near East, and parts of India. It is perfectly possible\nthat the flake and core-biface habits lasted on after 35,000 years ago,\nin some places outside of Europe. In northern Africa, for example, we\nare certain that they did (see chart, p. 72).\n\nOn the other hand, in the Far East (China, Burma, Java) and in northern\nIndia, the tools of the old chopper-tool tradition were still being\nmade. Out there, we must assume, there was a different set of loosely\nrelated cultures. At least, there was a different set of loosely\nrelated habits for the making of tools. But the men who made them must\nhave looked much like the men of the West. Their tools were different,\nbut just as useful.\n\nAs to what the men of the West looked like, Ive already hinted at all\nwe know so far (pp. 29 ff.). The Neanderthalers were present at\nthe time. Some more modern-like men must have been about, too, since\nfossils of them have turned up at Mount Carmel in Palestine, and at\nTeshik Tash, in Trans-caspian Russia. It is still too soon to know\nwhether certain combinations of tools within industries were made\nonly by certain physical types of men. But since tools of both the\ncore-biface and the flake traditions, and their blends, turn up from\nSouth Africa to England to India, it is most unlikely that only one\ntype of man used only one particular habit in the preparation of tools.\nWhat seems perfectly clear is that men in Africa and men in India were\nmaking just as good tools as the men who lived in western Europe.\n\n\n\n\nEARLY MODERNS\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nFrom some time during the first inter-stadial of the last great\nglaciation (say some time after about 40,000 years ago), we have\nmore accurate dates for the European-Mediterranean area and less\naccurate ones for the rest of the Old World. This is probably\nbecause the effects of the last glaciation have been studied in the\nEuropean-Mediterranean area more than they have been elsewhere.\n\n\nA NEW TRADITION APPEARS\n\nSomething new was probably beginning to happen in the\nEuropean-Mediterranean area about 40,000 years ago, though all the\nrest of the Old World seems to have been going on as it had been. I\ncant be sure of this because the information we are using as a basis\nfor dates is very inaccurate for the areas outside of Europe and the\nMediterranean.\n\nWe can at least make a guess. In Egypt and north Africa, men were still\nusing the old methods of making stone tools. This was especially true\nof flake tools of the Levalloisian type, save that they were growing\nsmaller and smaller as time went on. But at the same time, a new\ntradition was becoming popular in westernmost Asia and in Europe. This\nwas the blade-tool tradition.\n\n\nBLADE TOOLS\n\nA stone blade is really just a long parallel-sided flake, as the\ndrawing shows. It has sharp cutting edges, and makes a very useful\nknife. The real trick is to be able to make one. It is almost\nimpossible to make a blade out of any stone but flint or a natural\nvolcanic glass called obsidian. And even if you have flint or obsidian,\nyou first have to work up a special cone-shaped blade-core, from\nwhich to whack off blades.\n\n[Illustration: PLAIN BLADE]\n\nYou whack with a hammer stone against a bone or antler punch which is\ndirected at the proper place on the blade-core. The blade-core has to\nbe well supported or gripped while this is going on. To get a good\nflint blade tool takes a great deal of know-how.\n\nRemember that a tradition in stone tools means no more than that some\nparticular way of making the tools got started and lasted a long time.\nMen who made some tools in one tradition or set of habits would also\nmake other tools for different purposes by means of another tradition\nor set of habits. It was even possible for the two sets of habits to\nbecome combined.\n\n\nTHE EARLIEST BLADE TOOLS\n\nThe oldest blade tools we have found were deep down in the layers of\nthe Mount Carmel caves, in Tabun Eb and Ea. Similar tools have been\nfound in equally early cave levels in Syria; their popularity there\nseems to fluctuate a bit. Some more or less parallel-sided flakes are\nknown in the Levalloisian industry in France, but they are probably\nno earlier than Tabun E. The Tabun blades are part of a local late\nAcheulean industry, which is characterized by core-biface hand\naxes, but which has many flake tools as well. Professor F. E.\nZeuner believes that this industry may be more than 120,000 years old;\nactually its date has not yet been fixed, but it is very old--older\nthan the fossil finds of modern-like men in the same caves.\n\n[Illustration: SUCCESSION OF ICE AGE FLINT TYPES, INDUSTRIES, AND\nASSEMBLAGES, AND OF FOSSIL MEN, IN NORTHWESTERN EURAFRASIA]\n\nFor some reason, the habit of making blades in Palestine and Syria was\ninterrupted. Blades only reappeared there at about the same time they\nwere first made in Europe, some time after 45,000 years ago; that is,\nafter the first phase of the last glaciation was ended.\n\n[Illustration: BACKED BLADE]\n\nWe are not sure just where the earliest _persisting_ habits for the\nproduction of blade tools developed. Impressed by the very early\nmomentary appearance of blades at Tabun on Mount Carmel, Professor\nDorothy A. Garrod first favored the Near East as a center of origin.\nShe spoke of some as yet unidentified Asiatic centre, which she\nthought might be in the highlands of Iran or just beyond. But more\nrecent work has been done in this area, especially by Professor Coon,\nand the blade tools do not seem to have an early appearance there. When\nthe blade tools reappear in the Syro-Palestinian area, they do so in\nindustries which also include Levalloiso-Mousterian flake tools. From\nthe point of view of form and workmanship, the blade tools themselves\nare not so fine as those which seem to be making their appearance\nin western Europe about the same time. There is a characteristic\nSyro-Palestinian flake point, possibly a projectile tip, called the\nEmiran, which is not known from Europe. The appearance of blade tools,\ntogether with Levalloiso-Mousterian flakes, continues even after the\nEmiran point has gone out of use.\n\nIt seems clear that the production of blade tools did not immediately\nswamp the set of older habits in Europe, too; the use of flake\ntools also continued there. This was not so apparent to the older\narcheologists, whose attention was focused on individual tool types. It\nis not, in fact, impossible--although it is certainly not proved--that\nthe technique developed in the preparation of the Levalloisian tortoise\ncore (and the striking of the Levalloisian flake from it) might have\nfollowed through to the conical core and punch technique for the\nproduction of blades. Professor Garrod is much impressed with the speed\nof change during the later phases of the last glaciation, and its\nprobable consequences. She speaks of the greater number of industries\nhaving enough individual character to be classified as distinct ...\nsince evolution now starts to outstrip diffusion. Her evolution here\nis of course an industrial evolution rather than a biological one.\nCertainly the people of Europe had begun to make blade tools during\nthe warm spell after the first phase of the last glaciation. By about\n40,000 years ago blades were well established. The bones of the blade\ntool makers weve found so far indicate that anatomically modern men\nhad now certainly appeared. Unfortunately, only a few fossil men have\nso far been found from the very beginning of the blade tool range in\nEurope (or elsewhere). What I certainly shall _not_ tell you is that\nconquering bands of fine, strong, anatomically modern men, armed with\nsuperior blade tools, came sweeping out of the East to exterminate the\nlowly Neanderthalers. Even if we dont know exactly what happened, Id\nlay a good bet it wasnt that simple.\n\nWe do know a good deal about different blade industries in Europe.\nAlmost all of them come from cave layers. There is a great deal of\ncomplication in what we find. The chart (p. 72) tries to simplify\nthis complication; in fact, it doubtless simplifies it too much. But\nit may suggest all the complication of industries which is going\non at this time. You will note that the upper portion of my much\nsimpler chart (p. 65) covers the same material (in the section\nmarked Various Blade-Tool Industries). That chart is certainly too\nsimplified.\n\nYou will realize that all this complication comes not only from\nthe fact that we are finding more material. It is due also to the\nincreasing ability of men to adapt themselves to a great variety of\nsituations. Their tools indicate this adaptiveness. We know there was\na good deal of climatic change at this time. The plants and animals\nthat men used for food were changing, too. The great variety of tools\nand industries we now find reflect these changes and the ability of men\nto keep up with the times. Now, for example, is the first time we are\nsure that there are tools to _make_ other tools. They also show mens\nincreasing ability to adapt themselves.\n\n\nSPECIAL TYPES OF BLADE TOOLS\n\nThe most useful tools that appear at this time were made from blades.\n\n  1. The backed blade. This is a knife made of a flint blade, with\n     one edge purposely blunted, probably to save the users fingers\n     from being cut. There are several shapes of backed blades (p.\n     73).\n\n  [Illustration: TWO BURINS]\n\n  2. The _burin_ or graver. The burin was the original chisel. Its\n     cutting edge is _transverse_, like a chisels. Some burins are\n     made like a screw-driver, save that burins are sharp. Others have\n     edges more like the blade of a chisel or a push plane, with\n     only one bevel. Burins were probably used to make slots in wood\n     and bone; that is, to make handles or shafts for other tools.\n     They must also be the tools with which much of the engraving on\n     bone (see p. 83) was done. There is a bewildering variety of\n     different kinds of burins.\n\n[Illustration: TANGED POINT]\n\n  3. The tanged point. These stone points were used to tip arrows or\n     light spears. They were made from blades, and they had a long tang\n     at the bottom where they were fixed to the shaft. At the place\n     where the tang met the main body of the stone point, there was\n     a marked shoulder, the beginnings of a barb. Such points had\n     either one or two shoulders.\n\n[Illustration: NOTCHED BLADE]\n\n  4. The notched or strangulated blade. Along with the points for\n     arrows or light spears must go a tool to prepare the arrow or\n     spear shaft. Today, such a tool would be called a draw-knife or\n     a spoke-shave, and this is what the notched blades probably are.\n     Our spoke-shaves have sharp straight cutting blades and really\n     shave. Notched blades of flint probably scraped rather than cut.\n\n  5. The awl, drill, or borer. These blade tools are worked out\n     to a spike-like point. They must have been used for making holes\n     in wood, bone, shell, skin, or other things.\n\n[Illustration: DRILL OR AWL]\n\n  6. The end-scraper on a blade is a tool with one or both ends\n     worked so as to give a good scraping edge. It could have been used\n     to hollow out wood or bone, scrape hides, remove bark from trees,\n     and a number of other things (p. 78).\n\nThere is one very special type of flint tool, which is best known from\nwestern Europe in an industry called the Solutrean. These tools were\nusually made of blades, but the best examples are so carefully worked\non both sides (bifacially) that it is impossible to see the original\nblade. This tool is\n\n  7. The laurel leaf point. Some of these tools were long and\n     dagger-like, and must have been used as knives or daggers. Others\n     were small, called willow leaf, and must have been mounted on\n     spear or arrow shafts. Another typical Solutrean tool is the\n     shouldered point. Both the laurel leaf and shouldered point\n     types are illustrated (see above and p. 79).\n\n[Illustration: END-SCRAPER ON A BLADE]\n\n[Illustration: LAUREL LEAF POINT]\n\nThe industries characterized by tools in the blade tradition also\nyield some flake and core tools. We will end this list with two types\nof tools that appear at this time. The first is made of a flake; the\nsecond is a core tool.\n\n[Illustration: SHOULDERED POINT]\n\n  8. The keel-shaped round scraper is usually small and quite round,\n     and has had chips removed up to a peak in the center. It is called\n     keel-shaped because it is supposed to look (when upside down)\n     like a section through a boat. Actually, it looks more like a tent\n     or an umbrella. Its outer edges are sharp all the way around, and\n     it was probably a general purpose scraping tool (see illustration,\n     p. 81).\n\n  9. The keel-shaped nosed scraper is a much larger and heavier tool\n     than the round scraper. It was made on a core with a flat bottom,\n     and has one nicely worked end or nose. Such tools are usually\n     large enough to be easily grasped, and probably were used like\n     push planes (see illustration, p. 81).\n\n[Illustration: KEEL-SHAPED ROUND SCRAPER]\n\n[Illustration: KEEL-SHAPED NOSED SCRAPER]\n\nThe stone tools (usually made of flint) we have just listed are among\nthe most easily recognized blade tools, although they show differences\nin detail at different times. There are also many other kinds. Not\nall of these tools appear in any one industry at one time. Thus the\ndifferent industries shown in the chart (p. 72) each have only some\nof the blade tools weve just listed, and also a few flake tools. Some\nindustries even have a few core tools. The particular types of blade\ntools appearing in one cave layer or another, and the frequency of\nappearance of the different types, tell which industry we have in each\nlayer.\n\n\nOTHER KINDS OF TOOLS\n\nBy this time in Europe--say from about 40,000 to about 10,000 years\nago--we begin to find other kinds of material too. Bone tools begin\nto appear. There are knives, pins, needles with eyes, and little\ndouble-pointed straight bars of bone that were probably fish-hooks. The\nfish-line would have been fastened in the center of the bar; when the\nfish swallowed the bait, the bar would have caught cross-wise in the\nfishs mouth.\n\nOne quite special kind of bone tool is a long flat point for a light\nspear. It has a deep notch cut up into the breadth of its base, and is\ncalled a split-based bone point (p. 82). We know examples of bone\nbeads from these times, and of bone handles for flint tools. Pierced\nteeth of some animals were worn as beads or pendants, but I am not sure\nthat elks teeth were worn this early. There are even spool-shaped\nbuttons or toggles.\n\n[Illustration: SPLIT-BASED BONE POINT]\n\n[Illustration: SPEAR-THROWER]\n\n[Illustration: BONE HARPOON]\n\nAntler came into use for tools, especially in central and western\nEurope. We do not know the use of one particular antler tool that\nhas a large hole bored in one end. One suggestion is that it was\na thong-stropper used to strop or work up hide thongs (see\nillustration, below); another suggestion is that it was an arrow-shaft\nstraightener.\n\nAnother interesting tool, usually of antler, is the spear-thrower,\nwhich is little more than a stick with a notch or hook on one end.\nThe hook fits into the butt end of the spear, and the length of the\nspear-thrower allows you to put much more power into the throw (p.\n82). It works on pretty much the same principle as the sling.\n\nVery fancy harpoons of antler were also made in the latter half of\nthe period in western Europe. These harpoons had barbs on one or both\nsides and a base which would slip out of the shaft (p. 82). Some have\nengraved decoration.\n\n\nTHE BEGINNING OF ART\n\n[Illustration: THONG-STROPPER]\n\nIn western Europe, at least, the period saw the beginning of several\nkinds of art work. It is handy to break the art down into two great\ngroups: the movable art, and the cave paintings and sculpture. The\nmovable art group includes the scratchings, engravings, and modeling\nwhich decorate tools and weapons. Knives, stroppers, spear-throwers,\nharpoons, and sometimes just plain fragments of bone or antler are\noften carved. There is also a group of large flat pebbles which seem\nalmost to have served as sketch blocks. The surfaces of these various\nobjects may show animals, or rather abstract floral designs, or\ngeometric designs.\n\n[Illustration: VENUS FIGURINE FROM WILLENDORF]\n\nSome of the movable art is not done on tools. The most remarkable\nexamples of this class are little figures of women. These women seem to\nbe pregnant, and their most female characteristics are much emphasized.\nIt is thought that these Venus or Mother-goddess figurines may be\nmeant to show the great forces of nature--fertility and the birth of\nlife.\n\n\nCAVE PAINTINGS\n\nIn the paintings on walls and ceilings of caves we have some examples\nthat compare with the best art of any time. The subjects were usually\nanimals, the great cold-weather beasts of the end of the Ice Age: the\nmammoth, the wooly rhinoceros, the bison, the reindeer, the wild horse,\nthe bear, the wild boar, and wild cattle. As in the movable art, there\nare different styles in the cave art. The really great cave art is\npretty well restricted to southern France and Cantabrian (northwestern)\nSpain.\n\nThere are several interesting things about the Franco-Cantabrian cave\nart. It was done deep down in the darkest and most dangerous parts of\nthe caves, although the men lived only in the openings of caves. If you\nthink what they must have had for lights--crude lamps of hollowed stone\nhave been found, which must have burned some kind of oil or grease,\nwith a matted hair or fiber wick--and of the animals that may have\nlurked in the caves, youll understand the part about danger. Then,\ntoo, were sure the pictures these people painted were not simply to be\nlooked at and admired, for they painted one picture right over other\npictures which had been done earlier. Clearly, it was the _act_ of\n_painting_ that counted. The painter had to go way down into the most\nmysterious depths of the earth and create an animal in paint. Possibly\nhe believed that by doing this he gained some sort of magic power over\nthe same kind of animal when he hunted it in the open air. It certainly\ndoesnt look as if he cared very much about the picture he painted--as\na finished product to be admired--for he or somebody else soon went\ndown and painted another animal right over the one he had done.\n\nThe cave art of the Franco-Cantabrian style is one of the great\nartistic achievements of all time. The subjects drawn are almost always\nthe larger animals of the time: the bison, wild cattle and horses, the\nwooly rhinoceros, the mammoth, the wild boar, and the bear. In some of\nthe best examples, the beasts are drawn in full color and the paintings\nare remarkably alive and charged with energy. They come from the hands\nof men who knew the great animals well--knew the feel of their fur, the\ntremendous drive of their muscles, and the danger one faced when he\nhunted them.\n\nAnother artistic style has been found in eastern Spain. It includes\nlively drawings, often of people hunting with bow and arrow. The East\nSpanish art is found on open rock faces and in rock-shelters. It is\nless spectacular and apparently more recent than the Franco-Cantabrian\ncave art.\n\n\nLIFE AT THE END OF THE ICE AGE IN EUROPE\n\nLife in these times was probably as good as a hunter could expect it\nto be. Game and fish seem to have been plentiful; berries and wild\nfruits probably were, too. From France to Russia, great pits or\npiles of animal bones have been found. Some of this killing was done\nas our Plains Indians killed the buffalo--by stampeding them over\nsteep river banks or cliffs. There were also good tools for hunting,\nhowever. In western Europe, people lived in the openings of caves and\nunder overhanging rocks. On the great plains of eastern Europe, very\ncrude huts were being built, half underground. The first part of this\ntime must have been cold, for it was the middle and end phases of the\nlast great glaciation. Northern Europe from Scotland to Scandinavia,\nnorthern Germany and Russia, and also the higher mountains to the\nsouth, were certainly covered with ice. But people had fire, and the\nneedles and tools that were used for scraping hides must mean that they\nwore clothing.\n\nIt is clear that men were thinking of a great variety of things beside\nthe tools that helped them get food and shelter. Such burials as we\nfind have more grave-gifts than before. Beads and ornaments and often\nflint, bone, or antler tools are included in the grave, and sometimes\nthe body is sprinkled with red ochre. Red is the color of blood, which\nmeans life, and of fire, which means heat. Professor Childe wonders if\nthe red ochre was a pathetic attempt at magic--to give back to the body\nthe heat that had gone from it. But pathetic or not, it is sure proof\nthat these people were already moved by death as men still are moved by\nit.\n\nTheir art is another example of the direction the human mind was\ntaking. And when I say human, I mean it in the fullest sense, for this\nis the time in which fully modern man has appeared. On page 34, we\nspoke of the Cro-Magnon group and of the Combe Capelle-Brnn group of\nCaucasoids and of the Grimaldi Negroids, who are no longer believed\nto be Negroid. I doubt that any one of these groups produced most of\nthe achievements of the times. Its not yet absolutely sure which\nparticular group produced the great cave art. The artists were almost\ncertainly a blend of several (no doubt already mixed) groups. The pair\nof Grimaldians were buried in a grave with a sprinkling of red ochre,\nand were provided with shell beads and ornaments and with some blade\ntools of flint. Regardless of the different names once given them by\nthe human paleontologists, each of these groups seems to have shared\nequally in the cultural achievements of the times, for all that the\narcheologists can say.\n\n\nMICROLITHS\n\nOne peculiar set of tools seems to serve as a marker for the very last\nphase of the Ice Age in southwestern Europe. This tool-making habit is\nalso found about the shore of the Mediterranean basin, and it moved\ninto northern Europe as the last glaciation pulled northward. People\nbegan making blade tools of very small size. They learned how to chip\nvery slender and tiny blades from a prepared core. Then they made these\nlittle blades into tiny triangles, half-moons (lunates), trapezoids,\nand several other geometric forms. These little tools are called\nmicroliths. They are so small that most of them must have been fixed\nin handles or shafts.\n\n[Illustration: MICROLITHS\n\n  BLADE FRAGMENT\n  BURIN\n  LUNATE\n  TRAPEZOID\n  SCALENE TRIANGLE\n  ARROWHEAD]\n\nWe have found several examples of microliths mounted in shafts. In\nnorthern Europe, where their use soon spread, the microlithic triangles\nor lunates were set in rows down each side of a bone or wood point.\nOne corner of each little triangle stuck out, and the whole thing\nmade a fine barbed harpoon. In historic times in Egypt, geometric\ntrapezoidal microliths were still in use as arrowheads. They were\nfastened--broad end out--on the end of an arrow shaft. It seems queer\nto give an arrow a point shaped like a T. Actually, the little points\nwere very sharp, and must have pierced the hides of animals very\neasily. We also think that the broader cutting edge of the point may\nhave caused more bleeding than a pointed arrowhead would. In hunting\nfleet-footed animals like the gazelle, which might run for miles after\nbeing shot with an arrow, it was an advantage to cause as much bleeding\nas possible, for the animal would drop sooner.\n\nWe are not really sure where the microliths were first invented. There\nis some evidence that they appear early in the Near East. Their use\nwas very common in northwest Africa but this came later. The microlith\nmakers who reached south Russia and central Europe possibly moved up\nout of the Near East. Or it may have been the other way around; we\nsimply dont yet know.\n\nRemember that the microliths we are talking about here were made from\ncarefully prepared little blades, and are often geometric in outline.\nEach microlithic industry proper was made up, in good part, of such\ntiny blade tools. But there were also some normal-sized blade tools and\neven some flake scrapers, in most microlithic industries. I emphasize\nthis bladelet and the geometric character of the microlithic industries\nof the western Old World, since there has sometimes been confusion in\nthe matter. Sometimes small flake chips, utilized as minute pointed\ntools, have been called microliths. They may be _microlithic_ in size\nin terms of the general meaning of the word, but they do not seem to\nbelong to the sub-tradition of the blade tool preparation habits which\nwe have been discussing here.\n\n\nLATER BLADE-TOOL INDUSTRIES OF THE NEAR EAST AND AFRICA\n\nThe blade-tool industries of normal size we talked about earlier spread\nfrom Europe to central Siberia. We noted that blade tools were made\nin western Asia too, and early, although Professor Garrod is no longer\nsure that the whole tradition originated in the Near East. If you look\nagain at my chart (p. 72) you will note that in western Asia I list\nsome of the names of the western European industries, but with the\nqualification -like (for example, Gravettian-like). The western\nAsiatic blade-tool industries do vaguely recall some aspects of those\nof western Europe, but we would probably be better off if we used\ncompletely local names for them. The Emiran of my chart is such an\nexample; its industry includes a long spike-like blade point which has\nno western European counterpart.\n\nWhen we last spoke of Africa (p. 66), I told you that stone tools\nthere were continuing in the Levalloisian flake tradition, and were\nbecoming smaller. At some time during this process, two new tool\ntypes appeared in northern Africa: one was the Aterian point with\na tang (p. 67), and the other was a sort of laurel leaf point,\ncalled the Sbaikian. These two tool types were both produced from\nflakes. The Sbaikian points, especially, are roughly similar to some\nof the Solutrean points of Europe. It has been suggested that both the\nSbaikian and Aterian points may be seen on their way to France through\ntheir appearance in the Spanish cave deposits of Parpallo, but there is\nalso a rival pre-Solutrean in central Europe. We still do not know\nwhether there was any contact between the makers of these north African\ntools and the Solutrean tool-makers. What does seem clear is that the\nblade-tool tradition itself arrived late in northern Africa.\n\n\nNETHER AFRICA\n\nBlade tools and laurel leaf points and some other probably late\nstone tool types also appear in central and southern Africa. There\nare geometric microliths on bladelets and even some coarse pottery in\neast Africa. There is as yet no good way of telling just where these\nitems belong in time; in broad geological terms they are late.\nSome people have guessed that they are as early as similar European\nand Near Eastern examples, but I doubt it. The makers of small-sized\nLevalloisian flake tools occupied much of Africa until very late in\ntime.\n\n\nTHE FAR EAST\n\nIndia and the Far East still seem to be going their own way. In India,\nsome blade tools have been found. These are not well dated, save that\nwe believe they must be post-Pleistocene. In the Far East it looks as\nif the old chopper-tool tradition was still continuing. For Burma,\nDr. Movius feels this is fairly certain; for China he feels even more\ncertain. Actually, we know very little about the Far East at about the\ntime of the last glaciation. This is a shame, too, as you will soon\nagree.\n\n\nTHE NEW WORLD BECOMES INHABITED\n\nAt some time toward the end of the last great glaciation--almost\ncertainly after 20,000 years ago--people began to move over Bering\nStrait, from Asia into America. As you know, the American Indians have\nbeen assumed to be basically Mongoloids. New studies of blood group\ntypes make this somewhat uncertain, but there is no doubt that the\nancestors of the American Indians came from Asia.\n\nThe stone-tool traditions of Europe, Africa, the Near and Middle East,\nand central Siberia, did _not_ move into the New World. With only a\nvery few special or late exceptions, there are _no_ core-bifaces,\nflakes, or blade tools of the Old World. Such things just havent been\nfound here.\n\nThis is why I say its a shame we dont know more of the end of the\nchopper-tool tradition in the Far East. According to Weidenreich,\nthe Mongoloids were in the Far East long before the end of the last\nglaciation. If the genetics of the blood group types do demand a\nnon-Mongoloid ancestry for the American Indians, who else may have been\nin the Far East 25,000 years ago? We know a little about the habits\nfor making stone tools which these first people brought with them,\nand these habits dont conform with those of the western Old World.\nWed better keep our eyes open for whatever happened to the end of\nthe chopper-tool tradition in northern China; already there are hints\nthat it lasted late there. Also we should watch future excavations\nin eastern Siberia. Perhaps we shall find the chopper-tool tradition\nspreading up that far.\n\n\nTHE NEW ERA\n\nPerhaps it comes in part from the way I read the evidence and perhaps\nin part it is only intuition, but I feel that the materials of this\nchapter suggest a new era in the ways of life. Before about 40,000\nyears ago, people simply gathered their food, wandering over large\nareas to scavenge or to hunt in a simple sort of way. But here we\nhave seen them settling-in more, perhaps restricting themselves in\ntheir wanderings and adapting themselves to a given locality in more\nintensive ways. This intensification might be suggested by the word\ncollecting. The ways of life we described in the earlier chapters\nwere food-gathering ways, but now an era of food-collecting has\nbegun. We shall see further intensifications of it in the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\nEnd and PRELUDE\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nUp to the end of the last glaciation, we prehistorians have a\nrelatively comfortable time schedule. The farther back we go the less\nexact we can be about time and details. Elbow-room of five, ten,\neven fifty or more thousands of years becomes available for us to\nmaneuver in as we work backward in time. But now our story has come\nforward to the point where more exact methods of dating are at hand.\nThe radioactive carbon method reaches back into the span of the last\nglaciation. There are other methods, developed by the geologists and\npaleobotanists, which supplement and extend the usefulness of the\nradioactive carbon dates. And, happily, as our means of being more\nexact increases, our story grows more exciting. There are also more\ndetails of culture for us to deal with, which add to the interest.\n\n\nCHANGES AT THE END OF THE ICE AGE\n\nThe last great glaciation of the Ice Age was a two-part affair, with a\nsub-phase at the end of the second part. In Europe the last sub-phase\nof this glaciation commenced somewhere around 15,000 years ago. Then\nthe glaciers began to melt back, for the last time. Remember that\nProfessor Antevs (p. 19) isnt sure the Ice Age is over yet! This\nmelting sometimes went by fits and starts, and the weather wasnt\nalways changing for the better; but there was at least one time when\nEuropean weather was even better than it is now.\n\nThe melting back of the glaciers and the weather fluctuations caused\nother changes, too. We know a fair amount about these changes in\nEurope. In an earlier chapter, we said that the whole Ice Age was a\nmatter of continual change over long periods of time. As the last\nglaciers began to melt back some interesting things happened to mankind.\n\nIn Europe, along with the melting of the last glaciers, geography\nitself was changing. Britain and Ireland had certainly become islands\nby 5000 B.C. The Baltic was sometimes a salt sea, sometimes a large\nfresh-water lake. Forests began to grow where the glaciers had been,\nand in what had once been the cold tundra areas in front of the\nglaciers. The great cold-weather animals--the mammoth and the wooly\nrhinoceros--retreated northward and finally died out. It is probable\nthat the efficient hunting of the earlier people of 20,000 or 25,000\nto about 12,000 years ago had helped this process along (see p. 86).\nEuropeans, especially those of the post-glacial period, had to keep\nchanging to keep up with the times.\n\nThe archeological materials for the time from 10,000 to 6000 B.C. seem\nsimpler than those of the previous five thousand years. The great cave\nart of France and Spain had gone; so had the fine carving in bone and\nantler. Smaller, speedier animals were moving into the new forests. New\nways of hunting them, or ways of getting other food, had to be found.\nHence, new tools and weapons were necessary. Some of the people who\nmoved into northern Germany were successful reindeer hunters. Then the\nreindeer moved off to the north, and again new sources of food had to\nbe found.\n\n\nTHE READJUSTMENTS COMPLETED IN EUROPE\n\nAfter a few thousand years, things began to look better. Or at least\nwe can say this: By about 6000 B.C. we again get hotter archeological\nmaterials. The best of these come from the north European area:\nBritain, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, north Germany, southern Norway and\nSweden. Much of this north European material comes from bogs and swamps\nwhere it had become water-logged and has kept very well. Thus we have\nmuch more complete _assemblages_[4] than for any time earlier.\n\n  [4] Assemblage is a useful word when there are different kinds of\n      archeological materials belonging together, from one area and of\n      one time. An assemblage is made up of a number of industries\n      (that is, all the tools in chipped stone, all the tools in\n      bone, all the tools in wood, the traces of houses, etc.) and\n      everything else that manages to survive, such as the art, the\n      burials, the bones of the animals used as food, and the traces\n      of plant foods; in fact, everything that has been left to us\n      and can be used to help reconstruct the lives of the people to\n      whom it once belonged. Our own present-day assemblage would be\n      the sum total of all the objects in our mail-order catalogues,\n      department stores and supply houses of every sort, our churches,\n      our art galleries and other buildings, together with our roads,\n      canals, dams, irrigation ditches, and any other traces we might\n      leave of ourselves, from graves to garbage dumps. Not everything\n      would last, so that an archeologist digging us up--say 2,000\n      years from now--would find only the most durable items in our\n      assemblage.\n\nThe best known of these assemblages is the _Maglemosian_, named after a\ngreat Danish peat-swamp where much has been found.\n\n[Illustration: SKETCH OF MAGLEMOSIAN ASSEMBLAGE\n\n  CHIPPED STONE\n  HEMP\n  GROUND STONE\n  BONE AND ANTLER\n  WOOD]\n\nIn the Maglemosian assemblage the flint industry was still very\nimportant. Blade tools, tanged arrow points, and burins were still\nmade, but there were also axes for cutting the trees in the new\nforests. Moreover, the tiny microlithic blades, in a variety of\ngeometric forms, are also found. Thus, a specialized tradition that\npossibly began east of the Mediterranean had reached northern Europe.\nThere was also a ground stone industry; some axes and club-heads were\nmade by grinding and polishing rather than by chipping. The industries\nin bone and antler show a great variety of tools: axes, fish-hooks,\nfish spears, handles and hafts for other tools, harpoons, and clubs.\nA remarkable industry in wood has been preserved. Paddles, sled\nrunners, handles for tools, and bark floats for fish-nets have been\nfound. There are even fish-nets made of plant fibers. Canoes of some\nkind were no doubt made. Bone and antler tools were decorated with\nsimple patterns, and amber was collected. Wooden bows and arrows are\nfound.\n\nIt seems likely that the Maglemosian bog finds are remains of summer\ncamps, and that in winter the people moved to higher and drier regions.\nChilde calls them the Forest folk; they probably lived much the\nsame sort of life as did our pre-agricultural Indians of the north\ncentral states. They hunted small game or deer; they did a great deal\nof fishing; they collected what plant food they could find. In fact,\ntheir assemblage shows us again that remarkable ability of men to adapt\nthemselves to change. They had succeeded in domesticating the dog; he\nwas still a very wolf-like dog, but his long association with mankind\nhad now begun. Professor Coon believes that these people were direct\ndescendants of the men of the glacial age and that they had much the\nsame appearance. He believes that most of the Ice Age survivors still\nextant are living today in the northwestern European area.\n\n\nSOUTH AND CENTRAL EUROPE PERHAPS AS READJUSTED AS THE NORTH\n\nThere is always one trouble with things that come from areas where\npreservation is exceptionally good: The very quantity of materials in\nsuch an assemblage tends to make things from other areas look poor\nand simple, although they may not have been so originally at all. The\nassemblages of the people who lived to the south of the Maglemosian\narea may also have been quite large and varied; but, unfortunately,\nrelatively little of the southern assemblages has lasted. The\nwater-logged sites of the Maglemosian area preserved a great deal\nmore. Hence the Maglemosian itself _looks_ quite advanced to us, when\nwe compare it with the few things that have happened to last in other\nareas. If we could go back and wander over the Europe of eight thousand\nyears ago, we would probably find that the peoples of France, central\nEurope, and south central Russia were just as advanced as those of the\nnorth European-Baltic belt.\n\nSouth of the north European belt the hunting-food-collecting peoples\nwere living on as best they could during this time. One interesting\ngroup, which seems to have kept to the regions of sandy soil and scrub\nforest, made great quantities of geometric microliths. These are the\nmaterials called _Tardenoisian_. The materials of the Forest folk of\nFrance and central Europe generally are called _Azilian_; Dr. Movius\nbelieves the term might best be restricted to the area south of the\nLoire River.\n\n\nHOW MUCH REAL CHANGE WAS THERE?\n\nYou can see that no really _basic_ change in the way of life has yet\nbeen described. Childe sees the problem that faced the Europeans of\n10,000 to 3000 B.C. as a problem in readaptation to the post-glacial\nforest environment. By 6000 B.C. some quite successful solutions of\nthe problem--like the Maglemosian--had been made. The upsets that came\nwith the melting of the last ice gradually brought about all sorts of\nchanges in the tools and food-getting habits, but the people themselves\nwere still just as much simple hunters, fishers, and food-collectors as\nthey had been in 25,000 B.C. It could be said that they changed just\nenough so that they would not have to change. But there is a bit more\nto it than this.\n\nProfessor Mathiassen of Copenhagen, who knows the archeological remains\nof this time very well, poses a question. He speaks of the material\nas being neither rich nor progressive, in fact rather stagnant, but\nhe goes on to add that the people had a certain receptiveness and\nwere able to adapt themselves quickly when the next change did come.\nMy own understanding of the situation is that the Forest folk made\nnothing as spectacular as had the producers of the earlier Magdalenian\nassemblage and the Franco-Cantabrian art. On the other hand, they\n_seem_ to have been making many more different kinds of tools for many\nmore different kinds of tasks than had their Ice Age forerunners. I\nemphasize seem because the preservation in the Maglemosian bogs\nis very complete; certainly we cannot list anywhere near as many\ndifferent things for earlier times as we did for the Maglemosians\n(p. 94). I believe this experimentation with all kinds of new tools\nand gadgets, this intensification of adaptiveness (p. 91), this\nreceptiveness, even if it is still only pointed toward hunting,\nfishing, and food-collecting, is an important thing.\n\nRemember that the only marker we have handy for the _beginning_ of\nthis tendency toward receptiveness and experimentation is the\nlittle microlithic blade tools of various geometric forms. These, we\nsaw, began before the last ice had melted away, and they lasted on\nin use for a very long time. I wish there were a better marker than\nthe microliths but I do not know of one. Remember, too, that as yet\nwe can only use the microliths as a marker in Europe and about the\nMediterranean.\n\n\nCHANGES IN OTHER AREAS?\n\nAll this last section was about Europe. How about the rest of the world\nwhen the last glaciers were melting away?\n\nWe simply dont know much about this particular time in other parts\nof the world except in Europe, the Mediterranean basin and the Middle\nEast. People were certainly continuing to move into the New World by\nway of Siberia and the Bering Strait about this time. But for the\ngreater part of Africa and Asia, we do not know exactly what was\nhappening. Some day, we shall no doubt find out; today we are without\nclear information.\n\n\nREAL CHANGE AND PRELUDE IN THE NEAR EAST\n\nThe appearance of the microliths and the developments made by the\nForest folk of northwestern Europe also mark an end. They show us\nthe terminal phase of the old food-collecting way of life. It grows\nincreasingly clear that at about the same time that the Maglemosian and\nother Forest folk were adapting themselves to hunting, fishing, and\ncollecting in new ways to fit the post-glacial environment, something\ncompletely new was being made ready in western Asia.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have as much understanding of the climate and\nenvironment of the late Ice Age in western Asia as we have for most\nof Europe. Probably the weather was never so violent or life quite\nso rugged as it was in northern Europe. We know that the microliths\nmade their appearance in western Asia at least by 10,000 B.C. and\npossibly earlier, marking the beginning of the terminal phase of\nfood-collecting. Then, gradually, we begin to see the build-up towards\nthe first _basic change_ in human life.\n\nThis change amounted to a revolution just as important as the\nIndustrial Revolution. In it, men first learned to domesticate\nplants and animals. They began _producing_ their food instead of\nsimply gathering or collecting it. When their food-production\nbecame reasonably effective, people could and did settle down in\nvillage-farming communities. With the appearance of the little farming\nvillages, a new way of life was actually under way. Professor Childe\nhas good reason to speak of the food-producing revolution, for it was\nindeed a revolution.\n\n\nQUESTIONS ABOUT CAUSE\n\nWe do not yet know _how_ and _why_ this great revolution took place. We\nare only just beginning to put the questions properly. I suspect the\nanswers will concern some delicate and subtle interplay between man and\nnature. Clearly, both the level of culture and the natural condition of\nthe environment must have been ready for the great change, before the\nchange itself could come about.\n\nIt is going to take years of co-operative field work by both\narcheologists and the natural scientists who are most helpful to them\nbefore the _how_ and _why_ answers begin to appear. Anthropologically\ntrained archeologists are fascinated with the cultures of men in times\nof great change. About ten or twelve thousand years ago, the general\nlevel of culture in many parts of the world seems to have been ready\nfor change. In northwestern Europe, we saw that cultures changed\njust enough so that they would not have to change. We linked this to\nenvironmental changes with the coming of post-glacial times.\n\nIn western Asia, we archeologists can prove that the food-producing\nrevolution actually took place. We can see _the_ important consequence\nof effective domestication of plants and animals in the appearance of\nthe settled village-farming community. And within the village-farming\ncommunity was the seed of civilization. The way in which effective\ndomestication of plants and animals came about, however, must also be\nlinked closely with the natural environment. Thus the archeologists\nwill not solve the _how_ and _why_ questions alone--they will need the\nhelp of interested natural scientists in the field itself.\n\n\nPRECONDITIONS FOR THE REVOLUTION\n\nEspecially at this point in our story, we must remember how culture and\nenvironment go hand in hand. Neither plants nor animals domesticate\nthemselves; men domesticate them. Furthermore, men usually domesticate\nonly those plants and animals which are useful. There is a good\nquestion here: What is cultural usefulness? But I shall side-step it to\nsave time. Men cannot domesticate plants and animals that do not exist\nin the environment where the men live. Also, there are certainly some\nanimals and probably some plants that resist domestication, although\nthey might be useful.\n\nThis brings me back again to the point that _both_ the level of culture\nand the natural condition of the environment--with the proper plants\nand animals in it--must have been ready before domestication could\nhave happened. But this is precondition, not cause. Why did effective\nfood-production happen first in the Near East? Why did it happen\nindependently in the New World slightly later? Why also in the Far\nEast? Why did it happen at all? Why are all human beings not still\nliving as the Maglemosians did? These are the questions we still have\nto face.\n\n\nCULTURAL RECEPTIVENESS AND PROMISING ENVIRONMENTS\n\nUntil the archeologists and the natural scientists--botanists,\ngeologists, zoologists, and general ecologists--have spent many more\nyears on the problem, we shall not have full _how_ and _why_ answers. I\ndo think, however, that we are beginning to understand what to look for.\n\nWe shall have to learn much more of what makes the cultures of men\nreceptive and experimental. Did change in the environment alone\nforce it? Was it simply a case of Professor Toynbees challenge and\nresponse? I cannot believe the answer is quite that simple. Were it\nso simple, we should want to know why the change hadnt come earlier,\nalong with earlier environmental changes. We shall not know the answer,\nhowever, until we have excavated the traces of many more cultures of\nthe time in question. We shall doubtless also have to learn more about,\nand think imaginatively about, the simpler cultures still left today.\nThe mechanics of culture in general will be bound to interest us.\n\nIt will also be necessary to learn much more of the environments of\n10,000 to 12,000 years ago. In which regions of the world were the\nnatural conditions most promising? Did this promise include plants and\nanimals which could be domesticated, or did it only offer new ways of\nfood-collecting? There is much work to do on this problem, but we are\nbeginning to get some general hints.\n\nBefore I begin to detail the hints we now have from western Asia, I\nwant to do two things. First, I shall tell you of an old theory as to\nhow food-production might have appeared. Second, I will bother you with\nsome definitions which should help us in our thinking as the story goes\non.\n\n\nAN OLD THEORY AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE REVOLUTION\n\nThe idea that change would result, if the balance between nature\nand culture became upset, is of course not a new one. For at least\ntwenty-five years, there has been a general theory as to _how_ the\nfood-producing revolution happened. This theory depends directly on the\nidea of natural change in the environment.\n\nThe five thousand years following about 10,000 B.C. must have been\nvery difficult ones, the theory begins. These were the years when\nthe most marked melting of the last glaciers was going on. While the\nglaciers were in place, the climate to the south of them must have been\ndifferent from the climate in those areas today. You have no doubt read\nthat people once lived in regions now covered by the Sahara Desert.\nThis is true; just when is not entirely clear. The theory is that\nduring the time of the glaciers, there was a broad belt of rain winds\nsouth of the glaciers. These rain winds would have kept north Africa,\nthe Nile Valley, and the Middle East green and fertile. But when the\nglaciers melted back to the north, the belt of rain winds is supposed\nto have moved north too. Then the people living south and east of the\nMediterranean would have found that their water supply was drying up,\nthat the animals they hunted were dying or moving away, and that the\nplant foods they collected were dried up and scarce.\n\nAccording to the theory, all this would have been true except in the\nvalleys of rivers and in oases in the growing deserts. Here, in the\nonly places where water was left, the men and animals and plants would\nhave clustered. They would have been forced to live close to one\nanother, in order to live at all. Presently the men would have seen\nthat some animals were more useful or made better food than others,\nand so they would have begun to protect these animals from their\nnatural enemies. The men would also have been forced to try new plant\nfoods--foods which possibly had to be prepared before they could be\neaten. Thus, with trials and errors, but by being forced to live close\nto plants and animals, men would have learned to domesticate them.\n\n\nTHE OLD THEORY TOO SIMPLE FOR THE FACTS\n\nThis theory was set up before we really knew anything in detail about\nthe later prehistory of the Near and Middle East. We now know that\nthe facts which have been found dont fit the old theory at all well.\nAlso, I have yet to find an American meteorologist who feels that we\nknow enough about the changes in the weather pattern to say that it can\nhave been so simple and direct. And, of course, the glacial ice which\nbegan melting after 12,000 years ago was merely the last sub-phase of\nthe last great glaciation. There had also been three earlier periods\nof great alpine glaciers, and long periods of warm weather in between.\nIf the rain belt moved north as the glaciers melted for the last time,\nit must have moved in the same direction in earlier times. Thus, the\nforced neighborliness of men, plants, and animals in river valleys and\noases must also have happened earlier. Why didnt domestication happen\nearlier, then?\n\nFurthermore, it does not seem to be in the oases and river valleys\nthat we have our first or only traces of either food-production\nor the earliest farming villages. These traces are also in the\nhill-flanks of the mountains of western Asia. Our earliest sites of the\nvillage-farmers do not seem to indicate a greatly different climate\nfrom that which the same region now shows. In fact, everything we now\nknow suggests that the old theory was just too simple an explanation to\nhave been the true one. The only reason I mention it--beyond correcting\nthe ideas you may get in the general texts--is that it illustrates the\nkind of thinking we shall have to do, even if it is doubtless wrong in\ndetail.\n\nWe archeologists shall have to depend much more than we ever have on\nthe natural scientists who can really help us. I can tell you this from\nexperience. I had the great good fortune to have on my expedition staff\nin Iraq in 1954-55, a geologist, a botanist, and a zoologist. Their\nstudies added whole new bands of color to my spectrum of thinking about\n_how_ and _why_ the revolution took place and how the village-farming\ncommunity began. But it was only a beginning; as I said earlier, we are\njust now learning to ask the proper questions.\n\n\nABOUT STAGES AND ERAS\n\nNow come some definitions, so I may describe my material more easily.\nArcheologists have always loved to make divisions and subdivisions\nwithin the long range of materials which they have found. They often\ndisagree violently about which particular assemblage of material\ngoes into which subdivision, about what the subdivisions should be\nnamed, about what the subdivisions really mean culturally. Some\narcheologists, probably through habit, favor an old scheme of Grecized\nnames for the subdivisions: paleolithic, mesolithic, neolithic. I\nrefuse to use these words myself. They have meant too many different\nthings to too many different people and have tended to hide some pretty\nfuzzy thinking. Probably you havent even noticed my own scheme of\nsubdivision up to now, but Id better tell you in general what it is.\n\nI think of the earliest great group of archeological materials, from\nwhich we can deduce only a food-gathering way of culture, as the\n_food-gathering stage_. I say stage rather than age, because it\nis not quite over yet; there are still a few primitive people in\nout-of-the-way parts of the world who remain in the _food-gathering\nstage_. In fact, Professor Julian Steward would probably prefer to call\nit a food-gathering _level_ of existence, rather than a stage. This\nwould be perfectly acceptable to me. I also tend to find myself using\n_collecting_, rather than _gathering_, for the more recent aspects or\nera of the stage, as the word collecting appears to have more sense\nof purposefulness and specialization than does gathering (see p.\n91).\n\nNow, while I think we could make several possible subdivisions of the\nfood-gathering stage--I call my subdivisions of stages _eras_[5]--I\nbelieve the only one which means much to us here is the last or\n_terminal sub-era of food-collecting_ of the whole food-gathering\nstage. The microliths seem to mark its approach in the northwestern\npart of the Old World. It is really shown best in the Old World by\nthe materials of the Forest folk, the cultural adaptation to the\npost-glacial environment in northwestern Europe. We talked about\nthe Forest folk at the beginning of this chapter, and I used the\nMaglemosian assemblage of Denmark as an example.\n\n  [5] It is difficult to find words which have a sequence or gradation\n      of meaning with respect to both development and a range of time\n      in the past, or with a range of time from somewhere in the past\n      which is perhaps not yet ended. One standard Webster definition\n      of _stage_ is: One of the steps into which the material\n      development of man ... is divided. I cannot find any dictionary\n      definition that suggests which of the words, _stage_ or _era_,\n      has the meaning of a longer span of time. Therefore, I have\n      chosen to let my eras be shorter, and to subdivide my stages\n      into eras. Webster gives _era_ as: A signal stage of history,\n      an epoch. When I want to subdivide my eras, I find myself using\n      _sub-eras_. Thus I speak of the _eras_ within a _stage_ and of\n      the _sub-eras_ within an _era_; that is, I do so when I feel\n      that I really have to, and when the evidence is clear enough to\n      allow it.\n\nThe food-producing revolution ushers in the _food-producing stage_.\nThis stage began to be replaced by the _industrial stage_ only about\ntwo hundred years ago. Now notice that my stage divisions are in terms\nof technology and economics. We must think sharply to be sure that the\nsubdivisions of the stages, the eras, are in the same terms. This does\nnot mean that I think technology and economics are the only important\nrealms of culture. It is rather that for most of prehistoric time the\nmaterials left to the archeologists tend to limit our deductions to\ntechnology and economics.\n\nIm so soon out of my competence, as conventional ancient history\nbegins, that I shall only suggest the earlier eras of the\nfood-producing stage to you. This book is about prehistory, and Im not\na universal historian.\n\n\nTHE TWO EARLIEST ERAS OF THE FOOD-PRODUCING STAGE\n\nThe food-producing stage seems to appear in western Asia with really\nrevolutionary suddenness. It is seen by the relative speed with which\nthe traces of new crafts appear in the earliest village-farming\ncommunity sites weve dug. It is seen by the spread and multiplication\nof these sites themselves, and the remarkable growth in human\npopulation we deduce from this increase in sites. Well look at some\nof these sites and the archeological traces they yield in the next\nchapter. When such village sites begin to appear, I believe we are in\nthe _era of the primary village-farming community_. I also believe this\nis the second era of the food-producing stage.\n\nThe first era of the food-producing stage, I believe, was an _era of\nincipient cultivation and animal domestication_. I keep saying I\nbelieve because the actual evidence for this earlier era is so slight\nthat one has to set it up mainly by playing a hunch for it. The reason\nfor playing the hunch goes about as follows.\n\nOne thing we seem to be able to see, in the food-collecting era in\ngeneral, is a tendency for people to begin to settle down. This\nsettling down seemed to become further intensified in the terminal\nera. How this is connected with Professor Mathiassens receptiveness\nand the tendency to be experimental, we do not exactly know. The\nevidence from the New World comes into play here as well as that from\nthe Old World. With this settling down in one place, the people of the\nterminal era--especially the Forest folk whom we know best--began\nmaking a great variety of new things. I remarked about this earlier in\nthe chapter. Dr. Robert M. Adams is of the opinion that this atmosphere\nof experimentation with new tools--with new ways of collecting food--is\nthe kind of atmosphere in which one might expect trials at planting\nand at animal domestication to have been made. We first begin to find\ntraces of more permanent life in outdoor camp sites, although caves\nwere still inhabited at the beginning of the terminal era. It is not\nsurprising at all that the Forest folk had already domesticated the\ndog. In this sense, the whole era of food-collecting was becoming ready\nand almost incipient for cultivation and animal domestication.\n\nNorthwestern Europe was not the place for really effective beginnings\nin agriculture and animal domestication. These would have had to take\nplace in one of those natural environments of promise, where a variety\nof plants and animals, each possible of domestication, was available in\nthe wild state. Let me spell this out. Really effective food-production\nmust include a variety of items to make up a reasonably well-rounded\ndiet. The food-supply so produced must be trustworthy, even though\nthe food-producing peoples themselves might be happy to supplement\nit with fish and wild strawberries, just as we do when such things\nare available. So, as we said earlier, part of our problem is that\nof finding a region with a natural environment which includes--and\ndid include, some ten thousand years ago--a variety of possibly\ndomesticable wild plants and animals.\n\n\nNUCLEAR AREAS\n\nNow comes the last of my definitions. A region with a natural\nenvironment which included a variety of wild plants and animals,\nboth possible and ready for domestication, would be a central\nor core or _nuclear area_, that is, it would be when and _if_\nfood-production took place within it. It is pretty hard for me to\nimagine food-production having ever made an independent start outside\nsuch a nuclear area, although there may be some possible nuclear areas\nin which food-production never took place (possibly in parts of Africa,\nfor example).\n\nWe know of several such nuclear areas. In the New World, Middle America\nand the Andean highlands make up one or two; it is my understanding\nthat the evidence is not yet clear as to which. There seems to have\nbeen a nuclear area somewhere in southeastern Asia, in the Malay\npeninsula or Burma perhaps, connected with the early cultivation of\ntaro, breadfruit, the banana and the mango. Possibly the cultivation\nof rice and the domestication of the chicken and of zebu cattle and\nthe water buffalo belong to this southeast Asiatic nuclear area. We\nknow relatively little about it archeologically, as yet. The nuclear\narea which was the scene of the earliest experiment in effective\nfood-production was in western Asia. Since I know it best, I shall use\nit as my example.\n\n\nTHE NUCLEAR NEAR EAST\n\nThe nuclear area of western Asia is naturally the one of greatest\ninterest to people of the western cultural tradition. Our cultural\nheritage began within it. The area itself is the region of the hilly\nflanks of rain-watered grass-land which build up to the high mountain\nridges of Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Palestine. The map on page\n125 indicates the region. If you have a good atlas, try to locate the\nzone which surrounds the drainage basin of the Tigris and Euphrates\nRivers at elevations of from approximately 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The\nlower alluvial land of the Tigris-Euphrates basin itself has very\nlittle rainfall. Some years ago Professor James Henry Breasted called\nthe alluvial lands of the Tigris-Euphrates a part of the fertile\ncrescent. These alluvial lands are very fertile if irrigated. Breasted\nwas most interested in the oriental civilizations of conventional\nancient history, and irrigation had been discovered before they\nappeared.\n\nThe country of hilly flanks above Breasteds crescent receives from\n10 to 20 or more inches of winter rainfall each year, which is about\nwhat Kansas has. Above the hilly-flanks zone tower the peaks and ridges\nof the Lebanon-Amanus chain bordering the coast-line from Palestine\nto Turkey, the Taurus Mountains of southern Turkey, and the Zagros\nrange of the Iraq-Iran borderland. This rugged mountain frame for our\nhilly-flanks zone rises to some magnificent alpine scenery, with peaks\nof from ten to fifteen thousand feet in elevation. There are several\ngaps in the Mediterranean coastal portion of the frame, through which\nthe winters rain-bearing winds from the sea may break so as to carry\nrain to the foothills of the Taurus and the Zagros.\n\nThe picture I hope you will have from this description is that of an\nintermediate hilly-flanks zone lying between two regions of extremes.\nThe lower Tigris-Euphrates basin land is low and far too dry and hot\nfor agriculture based on rainfall alone; to the south and southwest, it\nmerges directly into the great desert of Arabia. The mountains which\nlie above the hilly-flanks zone are much too high and rugged to have\nencouraged farmers.\n\n\nTHE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE NUCLEAR NEAR EAST\n\nThe more we learn of this hilly-flanks zone that I describe, the\nmore it seems surely to have been a nuclear area. This is where we\narcheologists need, and are beginning to get, the help of natural\nscientists. They are coming to the conclusion that the natural\nenvironment of the hilly-flanks zone today is much as it was some eight\nto ten thousand years ago. There are still two kinds of wild wheat and\na wild barley, and the wild sheep, goat, and pig. We have discovered\ntraces of each of these at about nine thousand years ago, also traces\nof wild ox, horse, and dog, each of which appears to be the probable\nancestor of the domesticated form. In fact, at about nine thousand\nyears ago, the two wheats, the barley, and at least the goat, were\nalready well on the road to domestication.\n\nThe wild wheats give us an interesting clue. They are only available\ntogether with the wild barley within the hilly-flanks zone. While the\nwild barley grows in a variety of elevations and beyond the zone,\nat least one of the wild wheats does not seem to grow below the hill\ncountry. As things look at the moment, the domestication of both the\nwheats together could _only_ have taken place within the hilly-flanks\nzone. Barley seems to have first come into cultivation due to its\npresence as a weed in already cultivated wheat fields. There is also\na suggestion--there is still much more to learn in the matter--that\nthe animals which were first domesticated were most at home up in the\nhilly-flanks zone in their wild state.\n\nWith a single exception--that of the dog--the earliest positive\nevidence of domestication includes the two forms of wheat, the barley,\nand the goat. The evidence comes from within the hilly-flanks zone.\nHowever, it comes from a settled village proper, Jarmo (which Ill\ndescribe in the next chapter), and is thus from the era of the primary\nvillage-farming community. We are still without positive evidence of\ndomesticated grain and animals in the first era of the food-producing\nstage, that of incipient cultivation and animal domestication.\n\n\nTHE ERA OF INCIPIENT CULTIVATION AND ANIMAL DOMESTICATION\n\nI said above (p. 105) that my era of incipient cultivation and animal\ndomestication is mainly set up by playing a hunch. Although we cannot\nreally demonstrate it--and certainly not in the Near East--it would\nbe very strange for food-collectors not to have known a great deal\nabout the plants and animals most useful to them. They do seem to have\ndomesticated the dog. We can easily imagine them remembering to go\nback, season after season, to a particular patch of ground where seeds\nor acorns or berries grew particularly well. Most human beings, unless\nthey are extremely hungry, are attracted to baby animals, and many wild\npups or fawns or piglets must have been brought back alive by hunting\nparties.\n\nIn this last sense, man has probably always been an incipient\ncultivator and domesticator. But I believe that Adams is right in\nsuggesting that this would be doubly true with the experimenters of\nthe terminal era of food-collecting. We noticed that they also seem\nto have had a tendency to settle down. Now my hunch goes that _when_\nthis experimentation and settling down took place within a potential\nnuclear area--where a whole constellation of plants and animals\npossible of domestication was available--the change was easily made.\nProfessor Charles A. Reed, our field colleague in zoology, agrees that\nyear-round settlement with plant domestication probably came before\nthere were important animal domestications.\n\n\nINCIPIENT ERAS AND NUCLEAR AREAS\n\nI have put this scheme into a simple chart (p. 111) with the names\nof a few of the sites we are going to talk about. You will see that my\nhunch means that there are eras of incipient cultivation _only_ within\nnuclear areas. In a nuclear area, the terminal era of food-collecting\nwould probably have been quite short. I do not know for how long a time\nthe era of incipient cultivation and domestication would have lasted,\nbut perhaps for several thousand years. Then it passed on into the era\nof the primary village-farming community.\n\nOutside a nuclear area, the terminal era of food-collecting would last\nfor a long time; in a few out-of-the-way parts of the world, it still\nhangs on. It would end in any particular place through contact with\nand the spread of ideas of people who had passed on into one of the\nmore developed eras. In many cases, the terminal era of food-collecting\nwas ended by the incoming of the food-producing peoples themselves.\nFor example, the practices of food-production were carried into Europe\nby the actual movement of some numbers of peoples (we dont know how\nmany) who had reached at least the level of the primary village-farming\ncommunity. The Forest folk learned food-production from them. There\nwas never an era of incipient cultivation and domestication proper in\nEurope, if my hunch is right.\n\n\nARCHEOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES IN SEEING THE INCIPIENT ERA\n\nThe way I see it, two things were required in order that an era of\nincipient cultivation and domestication could begin. First, there had\nto be the natural environment of a nuclear area, with its whole group\nof plants and animals capable of domestication. This is the aspect of\nthe matter which weve said is directly given by nature. But it is\nquite possible that such an environment with such a group of plants\nand animals in it may have existed well before ten thousand years ago\nin the Near East. It is also quite possible that the same promising\ncondition may have existed in regions which never developed into\nnuclear areas proper. Here, again, we come back to the cultural factor.\nI think it was that atmosphere of experimentation weve talked about\nonce or twice before. I cant define it for you, other than to say that\nby the end of the Ice Age, the general level of many cultures was ready\nfor change. Ask me how and why this was so, and Ill tell you we dont\nknow yet, and that if we did understand this kind of question, there\nwould be no need for me to go on being a prehistorian!\n\n[Illustration: POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIPS OF STAGES AND ERAS IN WESTERN\nASIA AND NORTHEASTERN AFRICA]\n\nNow since this was an era of incipience, of the birth of new ideas,\nand of experimentation, it is very difficult to see its traces\narcheologically. New tools having to do with the new ways of getting\nand, in fact, producing food would have taken some time to develop.\nIt need not surprise us too much if we cannot find hoes for planting\nand sickles for reaping grain at the very beginning. We might expect\na time of making-do with some of the older tools, or with make-shift\ntools, for some of the new jobs. The present-day wild cousin of the\ndomesticated sheep still lives in the mountains of western Asia. It has\nno wool, only a fine down under hair like that of a deer, so it need\nnot surprise us to find neither the whorls used for spinning nor traces\nof woolen cloth. It must have taken some time for a wool-bearing sheep\nto develop and also time for the invention of the new tools which go\nwith weaving. It would have been the same with other kinds of tools for\nthe new way of life.\n\nIt is difficult even for an experienced comparative zoologist to tell\nwhich are the bones of domesticated animals and which are those of\ntheir wild cousins. This is especially so because the animal bones the\narcheologists find are usually fragmentary. Furthermore, we do not have\na sort of library collection of the skeletons of the animals or an\nherbarium of the plants of those times, against which the traces which\nthe archeologists find may be checked. We are only beginning to get\nsuch collections for the modern wild forms of animals and plants from\nsome of our nuclear areas. In the nuclear area in the Near East, some\nof the wild animals, at least, have already become extinct. There are\nno longer wild cattle or wild horses in western Asia. We know they were\nthere from the finds weve made in caves of late Ice Age times, and\nfrom some slightly later sites.\n\n\nSITES WITH ANTIQUITIES OF THE INCIPIENT ERA\n\nSo far, we know only a very few sites which would suit my notion of the\nincipient era of cultivation and animal domestication. I am closing\nthis chapter with descriptions of two of the best Near Eastern examples\nI know of. You may not be satisfied that what I am able to describe\nmakes a full-bodied era of development at all. Remember, however, that\nIve told you Im largely playing a kind of a hunch, and also that the\narcheological materials of this era will always be extremely difficult\nto interpret. At the beginning of any new way of life, there will be a\ngreat tendency for people to make-do, at first, with tools and habits\nthey are already used to. I would suspect that a great deal of this\nmaking-do went on almost to the end of this era.\n\n\nTHE NATUFIAN, AN ASSEMBLAGE OF THE INCIPIENT ERA\n\nThe assemblage called the Natufian comes from the upper layers of a\nnumber of caves in Palestine. Traces of its flint industry have also\nturned up in Syria and Lebanon. We dont know just how old it is. I\nguess that it probably falls within five hundred years either way of\nabout 5000 B.C.\n\nUntil recently, the people who produced the Natufian assemblage were\nthought to have been only cave dwellers, but now at least three open\nair Natufian sites have been briefly described. In their best-known\ndwelling place, on Mount Carmel, the Natufian folk lived in the open\nmouth of a large rock-shelter and on the terrace in front of it. On the\nterrace, they had set at least two short curving lines of stones; but\nthese were hardly architecture; they seem more like benches or perhaps\nthe low walls of open pens. There were also one or two small clusters\nof stones laid like paving, and a ring of stones around a hearth or\nfireplace. One very round and regular basin-shaped depression had been\ncut into the rocky floor of the terrace, and there were other less\nregular basin-like depressions. In the newly reported open air sites,\nthere seem to have been huts with rounded corners.\n\nMost of the finds in the Natufian layer of the Mount Carmel cave were\nflints. About 80 per cent of these flint tools were microliths made\nby the regular working of tiny blades into various tools, some having\ngeometric forms. The larger flint tools included backed blades, burins,\nscrapers, a few arrow points, some larger hacking or picking tools, and\none special type. This last was the sickle blade.\n\nWe know a sickle blade of flint when we see one, because of a strange\npolish or sheen which seems to develop on the cutting edge when the\nblade has been used to cut grasses or grain, or--perhaps--reeds. In\nthe Natufian, we have even found the straight bone handles in which a\nnumber of flint sickle blades were set in a line.\n\nThere was a small industry in ground or pecked stone (that is, abraded\nnot chipped) in the Natufian. This included some pestle and mortar\nfragments. The mortars are said to have a deep and narrow hole,\nand some of the pestles show traces of red ochre. We are not sure\nthat these mortars and pestles were also used for grinding food. In\naddition, there were one or two bits of carving in stone.\n\n\nNATUFIAN ANTIQUITIES IN OTHER MATERIALS; BURIALS AND PEOPLE\n\nThe Natufian industry in bone was quite rich. It included, beside the\nsickle hafts mentioned above, points and harpoons, straight and curved\ntypes of fish-hooks, awls, pins and needles, and a variety of beads and\npendants. There were also beads and pendants of pierced teeth and shell.\n\nA number of Natufian burials have been found in the caves; some burials\nwere grouped together in one grave. The people who were buried within\nthe Mount Carmel cave were laid on their backs in an extended position,\nwhile those on the terrace seem to have been flexed (placed in their\ngraves in a curled-up position). This may mean no more than that it was\neasier to dig a long hole in cave dirt than in the hard-packed dirt of\nthe terrace. The people often had some kind of object buried with them,\nand several of the best collections of beads come from the burials. On\ntwo of the skulls there were traces of elaborate head-dresses of shell\nbeads.\n\n[Illustration: SKETCH OF NATUFIAN ASSEMBLAGE\n\n  MICROLITHS\n  ARCHITECTURE?\n  BURIAL\n  CHIPPED STONE\n  GROUND STONE\n  BONE]\n\nThe animal bones of the Natufian layers show beasts of a modern type,\nbut with some differences from those of present-day Palestine. The\nbones of the gazelle far outnumber those of the deer; since gazelles\nlike a much drier climate than deer, Palestine must then have had much\nthe same climate that it has today. Some of the animal bones were those\nof large or dangerous beasts: the hyena, the bear, the wild boar,\nand the leopard. But the Natufian people may have had the help of a\nlarge domesticated dog. If our guess at a date for the Natufian is\nright (about 7750 B.C.), this is an earlier dog than was that in the\nMaglemosian of northern Europe. More recently, it has been reported\nthat a domesticated goat is also part of the Natufian finds.\n\nThe study of the human bones from the Natufian burials is not yet\ncomplete. Until Professor McCowns study becomes available, we may note\nProfessor Coons assessment that these people were of a basically\nMediterranean type.\n\n\nTHE KARIM SHAHIR ASSEMBLAGE\n\nKarim Shahir differs from the Natufian sites in that it shows traces\nof a temporary open site or encampment. It lies on the top of a bluff\nin the Kurdish hill-country of northeastern Iraq. It was dug by Dr.\nBruce Howe of the expedition I directed in 1950-51 for the Oriental\nInstitute and the American Schools of Oriental Research. In 1954-55,\nour expedition located another site, Mlefaat, with general resemblance\nto Karim Shahir, but about a hundred miles north of it. In 1956, Dr.\nRalph Solecki located still another Karim Shahir type of site called\nZawi Chemi Shanidar. The Zawi Chemi site has a radiocarbon date of 8900\n 300 B.C.\n\nKarim Shahir has evidence of only one very shallow level of occupation.\nIt was probably not lived on very long, although the people who lived\non it spread out over about three acres of area. In spots, the single\nlayer yielded great numbers of fist-sized cracked pieces of limestone,\nwhich had been carried up from the bed of a stream at the bottom of the\nbluff. We think these cracked stones had something to do with a kind of\narchitecture, but we were unable to find positive traces of hut plans.\nAt Mlefaat and Zawi Chemi, there were traces of rounded hut plans.\n\nAs in the Natufian, the great bulk of small objects of the Karim Shahir\nassemblage was in chipped flint. A large proportion of the flint tools\nwere microlithic bladelets and geometric forms. The flint sickle blade\nwas almost non-existent, being far scarcer than in the Natufian. The\npeople of Karim Shahir did a modest amount of work in the grinding of\nstone; there were milling stone fragments of both the mortar and the\nquern type, and stone hoes or axes with polished bits. Beads, pendants,\nrings, and bracelets were made of finer quality stone. We found a few\nsimple points and needles of bone, and even two rather formless unbaked\nclay figurines which seemed to be of animal form.\n\n[Illustration: SKETCH OF KARIM SHAHIR ASSEMBLAGE\n\n  CHIPPED STONE\n  GROUND STONE\n  UNBAKED CLAY\n  SHELL\n  BONE\n  ARCHITECTURE]\n\nKarim Shahir did not yield direct evidence of the kind of vegetable\nfood its people ate. The animal bones showed a considerable\nincrease in the proportion of the bones of the species capable of\ndomestication--sheep, goat, cattle, horse, dog--as compared with animal\nbones from the earlier cave sites of the area, which have a high\nproportion of bones of wild forms like deer and gazelle. But we do not\nknow that any of the Karim Shahir animals were actually domesticated.\nSome of them may have been, in an incipient way, but we have no means\nat the moment that will tell us from the bones alone.\n\n\nWERE THE NATUFIAN AND KARIM SHAHIR PEOPLES FOOD-PRODUCERS?\n\nIt is clear that a great part of the food of the Natufian people\nmust have been hunted or collected. Shells of land, fresh-water, and\nsea animals occur in their cave layers. The same is true as regards\nKarim Shahir, save for sea shells. But on the other hand, we have\nthe sickles, the milling stones, the possible Natufian dog, and the\ngoat, and the general animal situation at Karim Shahir to hint at an\nincipient approach to food-production. At Karim Shahir, there was the\ntendency to settle down out in the open; this is echoed by the new\nreports of open air Natufian sites. The large number of cracked stones\ncertainly indicates that it was worth the peoples while to have some\nkind of structure, even if the site as a whole was short-lived.\n\nIt is a part of my hunch that these things all point toward\nfood-production--that the hints we seek are there. But in the sense\nthat the peoples of the era of the primary village-farming community,\nwhich we shall look at next, are fully food-producing, the Natufian\nand Karim Shahir folk had not yet arrived. I think they were part of\na general build-up to full scale food-production. They were possibly\ncontrolling a few animals of several kinds and perhaps one or two\nplants, without realizing the full possibilities of this control as a\nnew way of life.\n\nThis is why I think of the Karim Shahir and Natufian folk as being at\na level, or in an era, of incipient cultivation and domestication. But\nwe shall have to do a great deal more excavation in this range of time\nbefore well get the kind of positive information we need.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nI am sorry that this chapter has had to be so much more about ideas\nthan about the archeological traces of prehistoric men themselves.\nBut the antiquities of the incipient era of cultivation and animal\ndomestication will not be spectacular, even when we do have them\nexcavated in quantity. Few museums will be interested in these\nantiquities for exhibition purposes. The charred bits or impressions\nof plants, the fragments of animal bone and shell, and the varied\nclues to climate and environment will be as important as the artifacts\nthemselves. It will be the ideas to which these traces lead us that\nwill be important. I am sure that this unspectacular material--when we\nhave much more of it, and learn how to understand what it says--will\nlead us to how and why answers about the first great change in human\nhistory.\n\nWe know the earliest village-farming communities appeared in western\nAsia, in a nuclear area. We do not yet know why the Near Eastern\nexperiment came first, or why it didnt happen earlier in some other\nnuclear area. Apparently, the level of culture and the promise of the\nnatural environment were ready first in western Asia. The next sites\nwe look at will show a simple but effective food-production already\nin existence. Without effective food-production and the settled\nvillage-farming communities, civilization never could have followed.\nHow effective food-production came into being by the end of the\nincipient era, is, I believe, one of the most fascinating questions any\narcheologist could face.\n\nIt now seems probable--from possibly two of the Palestinian sites with\nvarieties of the Natufian (Jericho and Nahal Oren)--that there were\none or more local Palestinian developments out of the Natufian into\nlater times. In the same way, what followed after the Karim Shahir type\nof assemblage in northeastern Iraq was in some ways a reflection of\nbeginnings made at Karim Shahir and Zawi Chemi.\n\n\n\n\nTHE First Revolution\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nAs the incipient era of cultivation and animal domestication passed\nonward into the era of the primary village-farming community, the first\nbasic change in human economy was fully achieved. In southwestern Asia,\nthis seems to have taken place about nine thousand years ago. I am\ngoing to restrict my description to this earliest Near Eastern case--I\ndo not know enough about the later comparable experiments in the Far\nEast and in the New World. Let us first, once again, think of the\ncontrast between food-collecting and food-producing as ways of life.\n\n\nTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOOD-COLLECTORS AND FOOD-PRODUCERS\n\nChilde used the word revolution because of the radical change that\ntook place in the habits and customs of man. Food-collectors--that is,\nhunters, fishers, berry- and nut-gatherers--had to live in small groups\nor bands, for they had to be ready to move wherever their food supply\nmoved. Not many people can be fed in this way in one area, and small\nchildren and old folks are a burden. There is not enough food to store,\nand it is not the kind that can be stored for long.\n\nDo you see how this all fits into a picture? Small groups of people\nliving now in this cave, now in that--or out in the open--as they moved\nafter the animals they hunted; no permanent villages, a few half-buried\nhuts at best; no breakable utensils; no pottery; no signs of anything\nfor clothing beyond the tools that were probably used to dress the\nskins of animals; no time to think of much of anything but food and\nprotection and disposal of the dead when death did come: an existence\nwhich takes nature as it finds it, which does little or nothing to\nmodify nature--all in all, a savages existence, and a very tough one.\nA man who spends his whole life following animals just to kill them to\neat, or moving from one berry patch to another, is really living just\nlike an animal himself.\n\n\nTHE FOOD-PRODUCING ECONOMY\n\nAgainst this picture let me try to draw another--that of mans life\nafter food-production had begun. His meat was stored on the hoof,\nhis grain in silos or great pottery jars. He lived in a house: it was\nworth his while to build one, because he couldnt move far from his\nfields and flocks. In his neighborhood enough food could be grown\nand enough animals bred so that many people were kept busy. They all\nlived close to their flocks and fields, in a village. The village was\nalready of a fair size, and it was growing, too. Everybody had more to\neat; they were presumably all stronger, and there were more children.\nChildren and old men could shepherd the animals by day or help with\nthe lighter work in the fields. After the crops had been harvested the\nyounger men might go hunting and some of them would fish, but the food\nthey brought in was only an addition to the food in the village; the\nvillagers wouldnt starve, even if the hunters and fishermen came home\nempty-handed.\n\nThere was more time to do different things, too. They began to modify\nnature. They made pottery out of raw clay, and textiles out of hair\nor fiber. People who became good at pottery-making traded their pots\nfor food and spent all of their time on pottery alone. Other people\nwere learning to weave cloth or to make new tools. There were already\npeople in the village who were becoming full-time craftsmen.\n\nOther things were changing, too. The villagers must have had\nto agree on new rules for living together. The head man of the\nvillage had problems different from those of the chief of the small\nfood-collectors band. If somebodys flock of sheep spoiled a wheat\nfield, the owner wanted payment for the grain he lost. The chief of\nthe hunters was never bothered with such questions. Even the gods\nhad changed. The spirits and the magic that had been used by hunters\nwerent of any use to the villagers. They needed gods who would watch\nover the fields and the flocks, and they eventually began to erect\nbuildings where their gods might dwell, and where the men who knew most\nabout the gods might live.\n\n\nWAS FOOD-PRODUCTION A REVOLUTION?\n\nIf you can see the difference between these two pictures--between\nlife in the food-collecting stage and life after food-production\nhad begun--youll see why Professor Childe speaks of a revolution.\nBy revolution, he doesnt mean that it happened over night or that\nit happened only once. We dont know exactly how long it took. Some\npeople think that all these changes may have occurred in less than\n500 years, but I doubt that. The incipient era was probably an affair\nof some duration. Once the level of the village-farming community had\nbeen established, however, things did begin to move very fast. By\nsix thousand years ago, the descendants of the first villagers had\ndeveloped irrigation and plow agriculture in the relatively rainless\nMesopotamian alluvium and were living in towns with temples. Relative\nto the half million years of food-gathering which lay behind, this had\nbeen achieved with truly revolutionary suddenness.\n\n\nGAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEAR EAST\n\nIf youll look again at the chart (p. 111) youll see that I have\nvery few sites and assemblages to name in the incipient era of\ncultivation and domestication, and not many in the earlier part of\nthe primary village-farming level either. Thanks in no small part\nto the intelligent co-operation given foreign excavators by the\nIraq Directorate General of Antiquities, our understanding of the\nsequence in Iraq is growing more complete. I shall use Iraq as my main\nyard-stick here. But I am far from being able to show you a series of\nSears Roebuck catalogues, even century by century, for any part of\nthe nuclear area. There is still a great deal of earth to move, and a\ngreat mass of material to recover and interpret before we even begin to\nunderstand how and why.\n\nPerhaps here, because this kind of archeology is really my specialty,\nyoull excuse it if I become personal for a moment. I very much look\nforward to having further part in closing some of the gaps in knowledge\nof the Near East. This is not, as Ive told you, the spectacular\nrange of Near Eastern archeology. There are no royal tombs, no gold,\nno great buildings or sculpture, no writing, in fact nothing to\nexcite the normal museum at all. Nevertheless it is a range which,\nidea-wise, gives the archeologist tremendous satisfaction. The country\nof the hilly flanks is an exciting combination of green grasslands\nand mountainous ridges. The Kurds, who inhabit the part of the area\nin which Ive worked most recently, are an extremely interesting and\nhospitable people. Archeologists dont become rich, but Ill forego\nthe Cadillac for any bright spring morning in the Kurdish hills, on a\ngood site with a happy crew of workmen and an interested and efficient\nstaff. It is probably impossible to convey the full feeling which life\non such a dig holds--halcyon days for the body and acute pleasurable\nstimulation for the mind. Old things coming newly out of the good dirt,\nand the pieces of the human puzzle fitting into place! I think I am\nan honest man; I cannot tell you that I am sorry the job is not yet\nfinished and that there are still gaps in this part of the Near Eastern\narcheological sequence.\n\n\nEARLIEST SITES OF THE VILLAGE FARMERS\n\nSo far, the Karim Shahir type of assemblage, which we looked at in the\nlast chapter, is the earliest material available in what I take to\nbe the nuclear area. We do not believe that Karim Shahir was a village\nsite proper: it looks more like the traces of a temporary encampment.\nTwo caves, called Belt and Hotu, which are outside the nuclear area\nand down on the foreshore of the Caspian Sea, have been excavated\nby Professor Coon. These probably belong in the later extension of\nthe terminal era of food-gathering; in their upper layers are traits\nlike the use of pottery borrowed from the more developed era of the\nsame time in the nuclear area. The same general explanation doubtless\nholds true for certain materials in Egypt, along the upper Nile and in\nthe Kharga oasis: these materials, called Sebilian III, the Khartoum\nneolithic, and the Khargan microlithic, are from surface sites,\nnot from caves. The chart (p. 111) shows where I would place these\nmaterials in era and time.\n\n[Illustration: THE HILLY FLANKS OF THE CRESCENT AND EARLY SITES OF THE\nNEAR EAST]\n\nBoth Mlefaat and Dr. Soleckis Zawi Chemi Shanidar site appear to have\nbeen slightly more settled in than was Karim Shahir itself. But I do\nnot think they belong to the era of farming-villages proper. The first\nsite of this era, in the hills of Iraqi Kurdistan, is Jarmo, on which\nwe have spent three seasons of work. Following Jarmo comes a variety of\nsites and assemblages which lie along the hilly flanks of the crescent\nand just below it. I am going to describe and illustrate some of these\nfor you.\n\nSince not very much archeological excavation has yet been done on sites\nof this range of time, I shall have to mention the names of certain\nsingle sites which now alone stand for an assemblage. This does not\nmean that I think the individual sites I mention were unique. In the\ntimes when their various cultures flourished, there must have been\nmany little villages which shared the same general assemblage. We are\nonly now beginning to locate them again. Thus, if I speak of Jarmo,\nor Jericho, or Sialk as single examples of their particular kinds of\nassemblages, I dont mean that they were unique at all. I think I could\ntake you to the sites of at least three more Jarmos, within twenty\nmiles of the original one. They are there, but they simply havent yet\nbeen excavated. In 1956, a Danish expedition discovered material of\nJarmo type at Shimshara, only two dozen miles northeast of Jarmo, and\nbelow an assemblage of Hassunan type (which I shall describe presently).\n\n\nTHE GAP BETWEEN KARIM SHAHIR AND JARMO\n\nAs we see the matter now, there is probably still a gap in the\navailable archeological record between the Karim Shahir-Mlefaat-Zawi\nChemi group (of the incipient era) and that of Jarmo (of the\nvillage-farming era). Although some items of the Jarmo type materials\ndo reflect the beginnings of traditions set in the Karim Shahir group\n(see p. 120), there is not a clear continuity. Moreover--to the\ndegree that we may trust a few radiocarbon dates--there would appear\nto be around two thousand years of difference in time. The single\navailable Zawi Chemi date is 8900  300 B.C.; the most reasonable\ngroup of dates from Jarmo average to about 6750  200 B.C. I am\nuncertain about this two thousand years--I do not think it can have\nbeen so long.\n\nThis suggests that we still have much work to do in Iraq. You can\nimagine how earnestly we await the return of political stability in the\nRepublic of Iraq.\n\n\nJARMO, IN THE KURDISH HILLS, IRAQ\n\nThe site of Jarmo has a depth of deposit of about twenty-seven feet,\nand approximately a dozen layers of architectural renovation and\nchange. Nevertheless it is a one period site: its assemblage remains\nessentially the same throughout, although one or two new items are\nadded in later levels. It covers about four acres of the top of a\nbluff, below which runs a small stream. Jarmo lies in the hill country\neast of the modern oil town of Kirkuk. The Iraq Directorate General of\nAntiquities suggested that we look at it in 1948, and we have had three\nseasons of digging on it since.\n\nThe people of Jarmo grew the barley plant and two different kinds of\nwheat. They made flint sickles with which to reap their grain, mortars\nor querns on which to crack it, ovens in which it might be parched, and\nstone bowls out of which they might eat their porridge. We are sure\nthat they had the domesticated goat, but Professor Reed (the staff\nzoologist) is not convinced that the bones of the other potentially\ndomesticable animals of Jarmo--sheep, cattle, pig, horse, dog--show\nsure signs of domestication. We had first thought that all of these\nanimals were domesticated ones, but Reed feels he must find out much\nmore before he can be sure. As well as their grain and the meat from\ntheir animals, the people of Jarmo consumed great quantities of land\nsnails. Botanically, the Jarmo wheat stands about half way between\nfully bred wheat and the wild forms.\n\n\nARCHITECTURE: HALL-MARK OF THE VILLAGE\n\nThe sure sign of the village proper is in its traces of architectural\npermanence. The houses of Jarmo were only the size of a small cottage\nby our standards, but each was provided with several rectangular rooms.\nThe walls of the houses were made of puddled mud, often set on crude\nfoundations of stone. (The puddled mud wall, which the Arabs call\n_touf_, is built by laying a three to six inch course of soft mud,\nletting this sun-dry for a day or two, then adding the next course,\netc.) The village probably looked much like the simple Kurdish farming\nvillage of today, with its mud-walled houses and low mud-on-brush\nroofs. I doubt that the Jarmo village had more than twenty houses at\nany one moment of its existence. Today, an average of about seven\npeople live in a comparable Kurdish house; probably the population of\nJarmo was about 150 people.\n\n[Illustration: SKETCH OF JARMO ASSEMBLAGE\n\n  CHIPPED STONE\n  UNBAKED CLAY\n  GROUND STONE\n  POTTERY _UPPER THIRD OF SITE ONLY._\n  REED MATTING\n  BONE\n  ARCHITECTURE]\n\nIt is interesting that portable pottery does not appear until the\nlast third of the life of the Jarmo village. Throughout the duration\nof the village, however, its people had experimented with the plastic\nqualities of clay. They modeled little figurines of animals and of\nhuman beings in clay; one type of human figurine they favored was that\nof a markedly pregnant woman, probably the expression of some sort of\nfertility spirit. They provided their house floors with baked-in-place\ndepressions, either as basins or hearths, and later with domed ovens of\nclay. As weve noted, the houses themselves were of clay or mud; one\ncould almost say they were built up like a house-sized pot. Then,\nfinally, the idea of making portable pottery itself appeared, although\nI very much doubt that the people of the Jarmo village discovered the\nart.\n\nOn the other hand, the old tradition of making flint blades and\nmicrolithic tools was still very strong at Jarmo. The sickle-blade was\nmade in quantities, but so also were many of the much older tool types.\nStrangely enough, it is within this age-old category of chipped stone\ntools that we see one of the clearest pointers to a newer age. Many of\nthe Jarmo chipped stone tools--microliths--were made of obsidian, a\nblack volcanic natural glass. The obsidian beds nearest to Jarmo are\nover three hundred miles to the north. Already a bulk carrying trade\nhad been established--the forerunner of commerce--and the routes were\nset by which, in later times, the metal trade was to move.\n\nThere are now twelve radioactive carbon dates from Jarmo. The most\nreasonable cluster of determinations averages to about 6750  200\nB.C., although there is a completely unreasonable range of dates\nrunning from 3250 to 9250 B.C.! _If_ I am right in what I take to be\nreasonable, the first flush of the food-producing revolution had been\nachieved almost nine thousand years ago.\n\n\nHASSUNA, IN UPPER MESOPOTAMIAN IRAQ\n\nWe are not sure just how soon after Jarmo the next assemblage of Iraqi\nmaterial is to be placed. I do not think the time was long, and there\nare a few hints that detailed habits in the making of pottery and\nground stone tools were actually continued from Jarmo times into the\ntime of the next full assemblage. This is called after a site named\nHassuna, a few miles to the south and west of modern Mosul. We also\nhave Hassunan type materials from several other sites in the same\ngeneral region. It is probably too soon to make generalizations about\nit, but the Hassunan sites seem to cluster at slightly lower elevations\nthan those we have been talking about so far.\n\nThe catalogue of the Hassuna assemblage is of course more full and\nelaborate than that of Jarmo. The Iraqi governments archeologists\nwho dug Hassuna itself, exposed evidence of increasing architectural\nknow-how. The walls of houses were still formed of puddled mud;\nsun-dried bricks appear only in later periods. There were now several\ndifferent ways of making and decorating pottery vessels. One style of\npottery painting, called the Samarran style, is an extremely handsome\none and must have required a great deal of concentration and excellence\nof draftsmanship. On the other hand, the old habits for the preparation\nof good chipped stone tools--still apparent at Jarmo--seem to have\nlargely disappeared by Hassunan times. The flint work of the Hassunan\ncatalogue is, by and large, a wretched affair. We might guess that the\nkinaesthetic concentration of the Hassuna craftsmen now went into other\ncategories; that is, they suddenly discovered they might have more fun\nworking with the newer materials. Its a shame, for example, that none\nof their weaving is preserved for us.\n\nThe two available radiocarbon determinations from Hassunan contexts\nstand at about 5100 and 5600 B.C.  250 years.\n\n\nOTHER EARLY VILLAGE SITES IN THE NUCLEAR AREA\n\nIll now name and very briefly describe a few of the other early\nvillage assemblages either in or adjacent to the hilly flanks of the\ncrescent. Unfortunately, we do not have radioactive carbon dates for\nmany of these materials. We may guess that some particular assemblage,\nroughly comparable to that of Hassuna, for example, must reflect a\nculture which lived at just about the same time as that of Hassuna. We\ndo this guessing on the basis of the general similarity and degree of\ncomplexity of the Sears Roebuck catalogues of the particular assemblage\nand that of Hassuna. We suppose that for sites near at hand and of a\ncomparable cultural level, as indicated by their generally similar\nassemblages, the dating must be about the same. We may also know that\nin a general stratigraphic sense, the sites in question may both appear\nat the bottom of the ascending village sequence in their respective\nareas. Without a number of consistent radioactive carbon dates, we\ncannot be precise about priorities.\n\n[Illustration: SKETCH OF HASSUNA ASSEMBLAGE\n\n  POTTERY\n  POTTERY OBJECTS\n  CHIPPED STONE\n  BONE\n  GROUND STONE\n  ARCHITECTURE\n  REED MATTING\n  BURIAL]\n\nThe ancient mound at Jericho, in the Dead Sea valley in Palestine,\nyields some very interesting material. Its catalogue somewhat resembles\nthat of Jarmo, especially in the sense that there is a fair depth\nof deposit without portable pottery vessels. On the other hand, the\narchitecture of Jericho is surprisingly complex, with traces of massive\nstone fortification walls and the general use of formed sun-dried\nmud brick. Jericho lies in a somewhat strange and tropically lush\necological niche, some seven hundred feet below sea level; it is\ngeographically within the hilly-flanks zone but environmentally not\npart of it.\n\nSeveral radiocarbon dates for Jericho fall within the range of those\nI find reasonable for Jarmo, and their internal statistical consistency\nis far better than that for the Jarmo determinations. It is not yet\nclear exactly what this means.\n\nThe mound at Jericho (Tell es-Sultan) contains a remarkably\nfine sequence, which perhaps does not have the gap we noted in\nIraqi-Kurdistan between the Karim Shahir group and Jarmo. While I am\nnot sure that the Jericho sequence will prove valid for those parts\nof Palestine outside the special Dead Sea environmental niche, the\nsequence does appear to proceed from the local variety of Natufian into\nthat of a very well settled community. So far, we have little direct\nevidence for the food-production basis upon which the Jericho people\nsubsisted.\n\nThere is an early village assemblage with strong characteristics of its\nown in the land bordering the northeast corner of the Mediterranean\nSea, where Syria and the Cilician province of Turkey join. This early\nSyro-Cilician assemblage must represent a general cultural pattern\nwhich was at least in part contemporary with that of the Hassuna\nassemblage. These materials from the bases of the mounds at Mersin, and\nfrom Judaidah in the Amouq plain, as well as from a few other sites,\nrepresent the remains of true villages. The walls of their houses were\nbuilt of puddled mud, but some of the house foundations were of stone.\nSeveral different kinds of pottery were made by the people of these\nvillages. None of it resembles the pottery from Hassuna or from the\nupper levels of Jarmo or Jericho. The Syro-Cilician people had not\nlost their touch at working flint. An important southern variation of\nthe Syro-Cilician assemblage has been cleared recently at Byblos, a\nport town famous in later Phoenician times. There are three radiocarbon\ndeterminations which suggest that the time range for these developments\nwas in the sixth or early fifth millennium B.C.\n\nIt would be fascinating to search for traces of even earlier\nvillage-farming communities and for the remains of the incipient\ncultivation era, in the Syro-Cilician region.\n\n\nTHE IRANIAN PLATEAU AND THE NILE VALLEY\n\nThe map on page 125 shows some sites which lie either outside or in\nan extension of the hilly-flanks zone proper. From the base of the\ngreat mound at Sialk on the Iranian plateau came an assemblage of\nearly village material, generally similar, in the kinds of things it\ncontained, to the catalogues of Hassuna and Judaidah. The details of\nhow things were made are different; the Sialk assemblage represents\nstill another cultural pattern. I suspect it appeared a bit later\nin time than did that of Hassuna. There is an important new item in\nthe Sialk catalogue. The Sialk people made small drills or pins of\nhammered copper. Thus the metallurgists specialized craft had made its\nappearance.\n\nThere is at least one very early Iranian site on the inward slopes\nof the hilly-flanks zone. It is the earlier of two mounds at a place\ncalled Bakun, in southwestern Iran; the results of the excavations\nthere are not yet published and we only know of its coarse and\nprimitive pottery. I only mention Bakun because it helps us to plot the\nextent of the hilly-flanks zone villages on the map.\n\nThe Nile Valley lies beyond the peculiar environmental zone of the\nhilly flanks of the crescent, and it is probable that the earliest\nvillage-farming communities in Egypt were established by a few people\nwho wandered into the Nile delta area from the nuclear area. The\nassemblage which is most closely comparable to the catalogue of Hassuna\nor Judaidah, for example, is that from little settlements along the\nshore of the Fayum lake. The Fayum materials come mainly from grain\nbins or silos. Another site, Merimde, in the western part of the Nile\ndelta, shows the remains of a true village, but it may be slightly\nlater than the settlement of the Fayum. There are radioactive carbon\ndates for the Fayum materials at about 4275 B.C.  320 years, which\nis almost fifteen hundred years later than the determinations suggested\nfor the Hassunan or Syro-Cilician assemblages. I suspect that this\nis a somewhat over-extended indication of the time it took for the\ngeneralized cultural pattern of village-farming community life to\nspread from the nuclear area down into Egypt, but as yet we have no way\nof testing these matters.\n\nIn this same vein, we have two radioactive carbon dates for an\nassemblage from sites near Khartoum in the Sudan, best represented by\nthe mound called Shaheinab. The Shaheinab catalogue roughly corresponds\nto that of the Fayum; the distance between the two places, as the Nile\nflows, is roughly 1,500 miles. Thus it took almost a thousand years for\nthe new way of life to be carried as far south into Africa as Khartoum;\nthe two Shaheinab dates average about 3300 B.C.  400 years.\n\nIf the movement was up the Nile (southward), as these dates suggest,\nthen I suspect that the earliest available village material of middle\nEgypt, the so-called Tasian, is also later than that of the Fayum. The\nTasian materials come from a few graves near a village called Deir\nTasa, and I have an uncomfortable feeling that the Tasian assemblage\nmay be mainly an artificial selection of poor examples of objects which\nbelong in the following range of time.\n\n\nSPREAD IN TIME AND SPACE\n\nThere are now two things we can do; in fact, we have already begun to\ndo them. We can watch the spread of the new way of life upward through\ntime in the nuclear area. We can also see how the new way of life\nspread outward in space from the nuclear area, as time went on. There\nis good archeological evidence that both these processes took place.\nFor the hill country of northeastern Iraq, in the nuclear area, we\nhave already noticed how the succession (still with gaps) from Karim\nShahir, through Mlefaat and Jarmo, to Hassuna can be charted (see\nchart, p. 111). In the next chapter, we shall continue this charting\nand description of what happened in Iraq upward through time. We also\nwatched traces of the new way of life move through space up the Nile\ninto Africa, to reach Khartoum in the Sudan some thirty-five hundred\nyears later than we had seen it at Jarmo or Jericho. We caught glimpses\nof it in the Fayum and perhaps at Tasa along the way.\n\nFor the remainder of this chapter, I shall try to suggest briefly for\nyou the directions taken by the spread of the new way of life from the\nnuclear area in the Near East. First, let me make clear again that\nI _do not_ believe that the village-farming community way of life\nwas invented only once and in the Near East. It seems to me that the\nevidence is very clear that a separate experiment arose in the New\nWorld. For China, the question of independence or borrowing--in the\nappearance of the village-farming community there--is still an open\none. In the last chapter, we noted the probability of an independent\nnuclear area in southeastern Asia. Professor Carl Sauer strongly\nchampions the great importance of this area as _the_ original center\nof agricultural pursuits, as a kind of cradle of all incipient eras\nof the Old World at least. While there is certainly not the slightest\narcheological evidence to allow us to go that far, we may easily expect\nthat an early southeast Asian development would have been felt in\nChina. However, the appearance of the village-farming community in the\nnorthwest of India, at least, seems to have depended on the earlier\ndevelopment in the Near East. It is also probable that ideas of the new\nway of life moved well beyond Khartoum in Africa.\n\n\nTHE SPREAD OF THE VILLAGE-FARMING COMMUNITY WAY OF LIFE INTO EUROPE\n\nHow about Europe? I wont give you many details. You can easily imagine\nthat the late prehistoric prelude to European history is a complicated\naffair. We all know very well how complicated an area Europe is now,\nwith its welter of different languages and cultures. Remember, however,\nthat a great deal of archeology has been done on the late prehistory of\nEurope, and very little on that of further Asia and Africa. If we knew\nas much about these areas as we do of Europe, I expect wed find them\njust as complicated.\n\nThis much is clear for Europe, as far as the spread of the\nvillage-community way of life is concerned. The general idea and much\nof the know-how and the basic tools of food-production moved from the\nNear East to Europe. So did the plants and animals which had been\ndomesticated; they were not naturally at home in Europe, as they were\nin western Asia. I do not, of course, mean that there were traveling\nsalesmen who carried these ideas and things to Europe with a commercial\ngleam in their eyes. The process took time, and the ideas and things\nmust have been passed on from one group of people to the next. There\nwas also some actual movement of peoples, but we dont know the size of\nthe groups that moved.\n\nThe story of the colonization of Europe by the first farmers is\nthus one of (1) the movement from the eastern Mediterranean lands\nof some people who were farmers; (2) the spread of ideas and things\nbeyond the Near East itself and beyond the paths along which the\ncolonists moved; and (3) the adaptations of the ideas and things\nby the indigenous Forest folk, about whose receptiveness Professor\nMathiassen speaks (p. 97). It is important to note that the resulting\ncultures in the new European environment were European, not Near\nEastern. The late Professor Childe remarked that the peoples of the\nWest were not slavish imitators; they adapted the gifts from the East\n... into a new and organic whole capable of developing on its own\noriginal lines.\n\n\nTHE WAYS TO EUROPE\n\nSuppose we want to follow the traces of those earliest village-farmers\nwho did travel from western Asia into Europe. Let us start from\nSyro-Cilicia, that part of the hilly-flanks zone proper which lies in\nthe very northeastern corner of the Mediterranean. Three ways would be\nopen to us (of course we could not be worried about permission from the\nSoviet authorities!). We would go north, or north and slightly east,\nacross Anatolian Turkey, and skirt along either shore of the Black Sea\nor even to the east of the Caucasus Mountains along the Caspian Sea,\nto reach the plains of Ukrainian Russia. From here, we could march\nacross eastern Europe to the Baltic and Scandinavia, or even hook back\nsouthwestward to Atlantic Europe.\n\nOur second way from Syro-Cilicia would also lie over Anatolia, to the\nnorthwest, where we would have to swim or raft ourselves over the\nDardanelles or the Bosphorus to the European shore. Then we would bear\nleft toward Greece, but some of us might turn right again in Macedonia,\ngoing up the valley of the Vardar River to its divide and on down\nthe valley of the Morava beyond, to reach the Danube near Belgrade\nin Jugoslavia. Here we would turn left, following the great river\nvalley of the Danube up into central Europe. We would have a number of\ntributary valleys to explore, or we could cross the divide and go down\nthe valley of the Rhine to the North Sea.\n\nOur third way from Syro-Cilicia would be by sea. We would coast along\nsouthern Anatolia and visit Cyprus, Crete, and the Aegean islands on\nour way to Greece, where, in the north, we might meet some of those who\nhad taken the second route. From Greece, we would sail on to Italy and\nthe western isles, to reach southern France and the coasts of Spain.\nEventually a few of us would sail up the Atlantic coast of Europe, to\nreach western Britain and even Ireland.\n\n[Illustration: PROBABLE ROUTES AND TIMING IN THE SPREAD OF THE\nVILLAGE-FARMING COMMUNITY WAY OF LIFE FROM THE NEAR EAST TO EUROPE]\n\nOf course none of us could ever take these journeys as the first\nfarmers took them, since the whole course of each journey must have\nlasted many lifetimes. The date given to the assemblage called Windmill\nHill, the earliest known trace of village-farming communities in\nEngland, is about 2500 B.C. I would expect about 5500 B.C. to be a\nsafe date to give for the well-developed early village communities of\nSyro-Cilicia. We suspect that the spread throughout Europe did not\nproceed at an even rate. Professor Piggott writes that at a date\nprobably about 2600 B.C., simple agricultural communities were being\nestablished in Spain and southern France, and from the latter region a\nspread northwards can be traced ... from points on the French seaboard\nof the [English] Channel ... there were emigrations of a certain number\nof these tribes by boat, across to the chalk lands of Wessex and Sussex\n[in England], probably not more than three or four generations later\nthan the formation of the south French colonies.\n\nNew radiocarbon determinations are becoming available all the\ntime--already several suggest that the food-producing way of life\nhad reached the lower Rhine and Holland by 4000 B.C. But not all\nprehistorians accept these dates, so I do not show them on my map\n(p. 139).\n\n\nTHE EARLIEST FARMERS OF ENGLAND\n\nTo describe the later prehistory of all Europe for you would take\nanother book and a much larger one than this is. Therefore, I have\ndecided to give you only a few impressions of the later prehistory of\nBritain. Of course the British Isles lie at the other end of Europe\nfrom our base-line in western Asia. Also, they received influences\nalong at least two of the three ways in which the new way of life\nmoved into Europe. We will look at more of their late prehistory in a\nfollowing chapter: here, I shall speak only of the first farmers.\n\nThe assemblage called Windmill Hill, which appears in the south of\nEngland, exhibits three different kinds of structures, evidence of\ngrain-growing and of stock-breeding, and some distinctive types of\npottery and stone implements. The most remarkable type of structure\nis the earthwork enclosures which seem to have served as seasonal\ncattle corrals. These enclosures were roughly circular, reached over\na thousand feet in diameter, and sometimes included two or three\nconcentric sets of banks and ditches. Traces of oblong timber houses\nhave been found, but not within the enclosures. The second type of\nstructure is mine-shafts, dug down into the chalk beds where good\nflint for the making of axes or hoes could be found. The third type\nof structure is long simple mounds or unchambered barrows, in one\nend of which burials were made. It has been commonly believed that the\nWindmill Hill assemblage belonged entirely to the cultural tradition\nwhich moved up through France to the Channel. Professor Piggott is now\nconvinced, however, that important elements of Windmill Hill stem from\nnorthern Germany and Denmark--products of the first way into Europe\nfrom the east.\n\nThe archeological traces of a second early culture are to be found\nin the west of England, western and northern Scotland, and most of\nIreland. The bearers of this culture had come up the Atlantic coast\nby sea from southern France and Spain. The evidence they have left us\nconsists mainly of tombs and the contents of tombs, with only very\nrare settlement sites. The tombs were of some size and received the\nbodies of many people. The tombs themselves were built of stone, heaped\nover with earth; the stones enclosed a passage to a central chamber\n(passage graves), or to a simple long gallery, along the sides of\nwhich the bodies were laid (gallery graves). The general type of\nconstruction is called megalithic (= great stone), and the whole\nearth-mounded structure is often called a _barrow_. Since many have\nproper chambers, in one sense or another, we used the term unchambered\nbarrow above to distinguish those of the Windmill Hill type from these\nmegalithic structures. There is some evidence for sacrifice, libations,\nand ceremonial fires, and it is clear that some form of community\nritual was focused on the megalithic tombs.\n\nThe cultures of the people who produced the Windmill Hill assemblage\nand of those who made the megalithic tombs flourished, at least in\npart, at the same time. Although the distributions of the two different\ntypes of archeological traces are in quite different parts of the\ncountry, there is Windmill Hill pottery in some of the megalithic\ntombs. But the tombs also contain pottery which seems to have arrived\nwith the tomb builders themselves.\n\nThe third early British group of antiquities of this general time\n(following 2500 B.C.) comes from sites in southern and eastern England.\nIt is not so certain that the people who made this assemblage, called\nPeterborough, were actually farmers. While they may on occasion have\npracticed a simple agriculture, many items of their assemblage link\nthem closely with that of the Forest folk of earlier times in\nEngland and in the Baltic countries. Their pottery is decorated with\nimpressions of cords and is quite different from that of Windmill Hill\nand the megalithic builders. In addition, the distribution of their\nfinds extends into eastern Britain, where the other cultures have left\nno trace. The Peterborough people had villages with semi-subterranean\nhuts, and the bones of oxen, pigs, and sheep have been found in a few\nof these. On the whole, however, hunting and fishing seem to have been\ntheir vital occupations. They also established trade routes especially\nto acquire the raw material for stone axes.\n\nA probably slightly later culture, whose traces are best known from\nSkara Brae on Orkney, also had its roots in those cultures of the\nBaltic area which fused out of the meeting of the Forest folk and\nthe peoples who took the eastern way into Europe. Skara Brae is very\nwell preserved, having been built of thin stone slabs about which\ndune-sand drifted after the village died. The individual houses, the\nbedsteads, the shelves, the chests for clothes and oddments--all built\nof thin stone-slabs--may still be seen in place. But the Skara Brae\npeople lived entirely by sheep- and cattle-breeding, and by catching\nshellfish. Neither grain nor the instruments of agriculture appeared at\nSkara Brae.\n\n\nTHE EUROPEAN ACHIEVEMENT\n\nThe above is only a very brief description of what went on in Britain\nwith the arrival of the first farmers. There are many interesting\ndetails which I have omitted in order to shorten the story.\n\nI believe some of the difficulty we have in understanding the\nestablishment of the first farming communities in Europe is with\nthe word colonization. We have a natural tendency to think of\ncolonization as it has happened within the last few centuries. In the\ncase of the colonization of the Americas, for example, the colonists\ncame relatively quickly, and in increasingly vast numbers. They had\nvastly superior technical, political, and war-making skills, compared\nwith those of the Indians. There was not much mixing with the Indians.\nThe case in Europe five or six thousand years ago must have been very\ndifferent. I wonder if it is even proper to call people colonists\nwho move some miles to a new region, settle down and farm it for some\nyears, then move on again, generation after generation? The ideas and\nthe things which these new people carried were only _potentially_\nsuperior. The ideas and things and the people had to prove themselves\nin their adaptation to each new environment. Once this was done another\nlink to the chain would be added, and then the forest-dwellers and\nother indigenous folk of Europe along the way might accept the new\nideas and things. It is quite reasonable to expect that there must have\nbeen much mixture of the migrants and the indigenes along the way; the\nPeterborough and Skara Brae assemblages we mentioned above would seem\nto be clear traces of such fused cultures. Sometimes, especially if the\nmigrants were moving by boat, long distances may have been covered in\na short time. Remember, however, we seem to have about three thousand\nyears between the early Syro-Cilician villages and Windmill Hill.\n\nLet me repeat Professor Childe again. The peoples of the West were\nnot slavish imitators: they adapted the gifts from the East ... into\na new and organic whole capable of developing on its own original\nlines. Childe is of course completely conscious of the fact that his\npeoples of the West were in part the descendants of migrants who came\noriginally from the East, bringing their gifts with them. This\nwas the late prehistoric achievement of Europe--to take new ideas and\nthings and some migrant peoples and, by mixing them with the old in its\nown environments, to forge a new and unique series of cultures.\n\nWhat we know of the ways of men suggests to us that when the details\nof the later prehistory of further Asia and Africa are learned, their\nstories will be just as exciting.\n\n\n\n\nTHE Conquest of Civilization\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nNow we must return to the Near East again. We are coming to the point\nwhere history is about to begin. I am going to stick pretty close\nto Iraq and Egypt in this chapter. These countries will perhaps be\nthe most interesting to most of us, for the foundations of western\ncivilization were laid in the river lands of the Tigris and Euphrates\nand of the Nile. I shall probably stick closest of all to Iraq, because\nthings first happened there and also because I know it best.\n\nThere is another interesting thing, too. We have seen that the first\nexperiment in village-farming took place in the Near East. So did\nthe first experiment in civilization. Both experiments took. The\ntraditions we live by today are based, ultimately, on those ancient\nbeginnings in food-production and civilization in the Near East.\n\n\nWHAT CIVILIZATION MEANS\n\nI shall not try to define civilization for you; rather, I shall\ntell you what the word brings to my mind. To me civilization means\nurbanization: the fact that there are cities. It means a formal\npolitical set-up--that there are kings or governing bodies that the\npeople have set up. It means formal laws--rules of conduct--which the\ngovernment (if not the people) believes are necessary. It probably\nmeans that there are formalized projects--roads, harbors, irrigation\ncanals, and the like--and also some sort of army or police force\nto protect them. It means quite new and different art forms. It\nalso usually means there is writing. (The people of the Andes--the\nIncas--had everything which goes to make up a civilization but formal\nwriting. I can see no reason to say they were not civilized.) Finally,\nas the late Professor Redfield reminded us, civilization seems to bring\nwith it the dawn of a new kind of moral order.\n\nIn different civilizations, there may be important differences in the\nway such things as the above are managed. In early civilizations, it is\nusual to find religion very closely tied in with government, law, and\nso forth. The king may also be a high priest, or he may even be thought\nof as a god. The laws are usually thought to have been given to the\npeople by the gods. The temples are protected just as carefully as the\nother projects.\n\n\nCIVILIZATION IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT FOOD-PRODUCTION\n\nCivilizations have to be made up of many people. Some of the people\nlive in the country; some live in very large towns or cities. Classes\nof society have begun. There are officials and government people; there\nare priests or religious officials; there are merchants and traders;\nthere are craftsmen, metal-workers, potters, builders, and so on; there\nare also farmers, and these are the people who produce the food for the\nwhole population. It must be obvious that civilization cannot exist\nwithout food-production and that food-production must also be at a\npretty efficient level of village-farming before civilization can even\nbegin.\n\nBut people can be food-producing without being civilized. In many\nparts of the world this is still the case. When the white men first\ncame to America, the Indians in most parts of this hemisphere were\nfood-producers. They grew corn, potatoes, tomatoes, squash, and many\nother things the white men had never eaten before. But only the Aztecs\nof Mexico, the Mayas of Yucatan and Guatemala, and the Incas of the\nAndes were civilized.\n\n\nWHY DIDNT CIVILIZATION COME TO ALL FOOD-PRODUCERS?\n\nOnce you have food-production, even at the well-advanced level of\nthe village-farming community, what else has to happen before you\nget civilization? Many men have asked this question and have failed\nto give a full and satisfactory answer. There is probably no _one_\nanswer. I shall give you my own idea about how civilization _may_ have\ncome about in the Near East alone. Remember, it is only a guess--a\nputting together of hunches from incomplete evidence. It is _not_ meant\nto explain how civilization began in any of the other areas--China,\nsoutheast Asia, the Americas--where other early experiments in\ncivilization went on. The details in those areas are quite different.\nWhether certain general principles hold, for the appearance of any\nearly civilization, is still an open and very interesting question.\n\n\nWHERE CIVILIZATION FIRST APPEARED IN THE NEAR EAST\n\nYou remember that our earliest village-farming communities lay along\nthe hilly flanks of a great crescent. (See map on p. 125.)\nProfessor Breasteds fertile crescent emphasized the rich river\nvalleys of the Nile and the Tigris-Euphrates Rivers. Our hilly-flanks\narea of the crescent zone arches up from Egypt through Palestine and\nSyria, along southern Turkey into northern Iraq, and down along the\nsouthwestern fringe of Iran. The earliest food-producing villages we\nknow already existed in this area by about 6750 B.C. ( 200 years).\n\nNow notice that this hilly-flanks zone does not include southern\nMesopotamia, the alluvial land of the lower Tigris and Euphrates in\nIraq, or the Nile Valley proper. The earliest known villages of classic\nMesopotamia and Egypt seem to appear fifteen hundred or more years\nafter those of the hilly-flanks zone. For example, the early Fayum\nvillage which lies near a lake west of the Nile Valley proper (see p.\n135) has a radiocarbon date of 4275 B.C.  320 years. It was in the\nriver lands, however, that the immediate beginnings of civilization\nwere made.\n\nWe know that by about 3200 B.C. the Early Dynastic period had begun\nin southern Mesopotamia. The beginnings of writing go back several\nhundred years earlier, but we can safely say that civilization had\nbegun in Mesopotamia by 3200 B.C. In Egypt, the beginning of the First\nDynasty is slightly later, at about 3100 B.C., and writing probably\ndid not appear much earlier. There is no question but that history and\ncivilization were well under way in both Mesopotamia and Egypt by 3000\nB.C.--about five thousand years ago.\n\n\nTHE HILLY-FLANKS ZONE VERSUS THE RIVER LANDS\n\nWhy did these two civilizations spring up in these two river\nlands which apparently were not even part of the area where the\nvillage-farming community began? Why didnt we have the first\ncivilizations in Palestine, Syria, north Iraq, or Iran, where were\nsure food-production had had a long time to develop? I think the\nprobable answer gives a clue to the ways in which civilization began in\nEgypt and Mesopotamia.\n\nThe land in the hilly flanks is of a sort which people can farm without\ntoo much trouble. There is a fairly fertile coastal strip in Palestine\nand Syria. There are pleasant mountain slopes, streams running out to\nthe sea, and rain, at least in the winter months. The rain belt and the\nfoothills of the Turkish mountains also extend to northern Iraq and on\nto the Iranian plateau. The Iranian plateau has its mountain valleys,\nstreams, and some rain. These hilly flanks of the crescent, through\nmost of its arc, are almost made-to-order for beginning farmers. The\ngrassy slopes of the higher hills would be pasture for their herds\nand flocks. As soon as the earliest experiments with agriculture and\ndomestic animals had been successful, a pleasant living could be\nmade--and without too much trouble.\n\nI should add here again, that our evidence points increasingly to a\nclimate for those times which is very little different from that for\nthe area today. Now look at Egypt and southern Mesopotamia. Both are\nlands without rain, for all intents and purposes. Both are lands with\nrivers that have laid down very fertile soil--soil perhaps superior to\nthat in the hilly flanks. But in both lands, the rivers are of no great\naid without some control.\n\nThe Nile floods its banks once a year, in late September or early\nOctober. It not only soaks the narrow fertile strip of land on either\nside; it lays down a fresh layer of new soil each year. Beyond the\nfertile strip on either side rise great cliffs, and behind them is the\ndesert. In its natural, uncontrolled state, the yearly flood of the\nNile must have caused short-lived swamps that were full of crocodiles.\nAfter a short time, the flood level would have dropped, the water and\nthe crocodiles would have run back into the river, and the swamp plants\nwould have become parched and dry.\n\nThe Tigris and the Euphrates of Mesopotamia are less likely to flood\nregularly than the Nile. The Tigris has a shorter and straighter course\nthan the Euphrates; it is also the more violent river. Its banks are\nhigh, and when the snows melt and flow into all of its tributary rivers\nit is swift and dangerous. The Euphrates has a much longer and more\ncurving course and few important tributaries. Its banks are lower and\nit is less likely to flood dangerously. The land on either side and\nbetween the two rivers is very fertile, south of the modern city of\nBaghdad. Unlike the Nile Valley, neither the Tigris nor the Euphrates\nis flanked by cliffs. The land on either side of the rivers stretches\nout for miles and is not much rougher than a poor tennis court.\n\n\nTHE RIVERS MUST BE CONTROLLED\n\nThe real trick in both Egypt and Mesopotamia is to make the rivers work\nfor you. In Egypt, this is a matter of building dikes and reservoirs\nthat will catch and hold the Nile flood. In this way, the water is held\nand allowed to run off over the fields as it is needed. In Mesopotamia,\nit is a matter of taking advantage of natural river channels and branch\nchannels, and of leading ditches from these onto the fields.\n\nObviously, we can no longer find the first dikes or reservoirs of\nthe Nile Valley, or the first canals or ditches of Mesopotamia. The\nsame land has been lived on far too long for any traces of the first\nattempts to be left; or, especially in Egypt, it has been covered by\nthe yearly deposits of silt, dropped by the river floods. But were\npretty sure the first food-producers of Egypt and southern Mesopotamia\nmust have made such dikes, canals, and ditches. In the first place,\nthere cant have been enough rain for them to grow things otherwise.\nIn the second place, the patterns for such projects seem to have been\npretty well set by historic times.\n\n\nCONTROL OF THE RIVERS THE BUSINESS OF EVERYONE\n\nHere, then, is a _part_ of the reason why civilization grew in Egypt\nand Mesopotamia first--not in Palestine, Syria, or Iran. In the latter\nareas, people could manage to produce their food as individuals. It\nwasnt too hard; there were rain and some streams, and good pasturage\nfor the animals even if a crop or two went wrong. In Egypt and\nMesopotamia, people had to put in a much greater amount of work, and\nthis work couldnt be individual work. Whole villages or groups of\npeople had to turn out to fix dikes or dig ditches. The dikes had to be\nrepaired and the ditches carefully cleared of silt each year, or they\nwould become useless.\n\nThere also had to be hard and fast rules. The person who lived nearest\nthe ditch or the reservoir must not be allowed to take all the water\nand leave none for his neighbors. It was not only a business of\nlearning to control the rivers and of making their waters do the\nfarmers work. It also meant controlling men. But once these men had\nmanaged both kinds of controls, what a wonderful yield they had! The\nsoil was already fertile, and the silt which came in the floods and\nditches kept adding fertile soil.\n\n\nTHE GERM OF CIVILIZATION IN EGYPT AND MESOPOTAMIA\n\nThis learning to work together for the common good was the real germ of\nthe Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations. The bare elements of\ncivilization were already there: the need for a governing hand and for\nlaws to see that the communities work was done and that the water was\njustly shared. You may object that there is a sort of chicken and egg\nparadox in this idea. How could the people set up the rules until they\nhad managed to get a way to live, and how could they manage to get a\nway to live until they had set up the rules? I think that small groups\nmust have moved down along the mud-flats of the river banks quite\nearly, making use of naturally favorable spots, and that the rules grew\nout of such cases. It would have been like the hand-in-hand growth of\nautomobiles and paved highways in the United States.\n\nOnce the rules and the know-how did get going, there must have been a\nconstant interplay of the two. Thus, the more the crops yielded, the\nricher and better-fed the people would have been, and the more the\npopulation would have grown. As the population grew, more land would\nhave needed to be flooded or irrigated, and more complex systems of\ndikes, reservoirs, canals, and ditches would have been built. The more\ncomplex the system, the more necessity for work on new projects and for\nthe control of their use.... And so on....\n\nWhat I have just put down for you is a guess at the manner of growth of\nsome of the formalized systems that go to make up a civilized society.\nMy explanation has been pointed particularly at Egypt and Mesopotamia.\nI have already told you that the irrigation and water-control part of\nit does not apply to the development of the Aztecs or the Mayas, or\nperhaps anybody else. But I think that a fair part of the story of\nEgypt and Mesopotamia must be as Ive just told you.\n\nI am particularly anxious that you do _not_ understand me to mean that\nirrigation _caused_ civilization. I am sure it was not that simple at\nall. For, in fact, a complex and highly engineered irrigation system\nproper did not come until later times. Lets say rather that the simple\nbeginnings of irrigation allowed and in fact encouraged a great number\nof things in the technological, political, social, and moral realms of\nculture. We do not yet understand what all these things were or how\nthey worked. But without these other aspects of culture, I do not\nthink that urbanization and civilization itself could have come into\nbeing.\n\n\nTHE ARCHEOLOGICAL SEQUENCE TO CIVILIZATION IN IRAQ\n\nWe last spoke of the archeological materials of Iraq on page 130,\nwhere I described the village-farming community of Hassunan type. The\nHassunan type villages appear in the hilly-flanks zone and in the\nrolling land adjacent to the Tigris in northern Iraq. It is probable\nthat even before the Hassuna pattern of culture lived its course, a\nnew assemblage had been established in northern Iraq and Syria. This\nassemblage is called Halaf, after a site high on a tributary of the\nEuphrates, on the Syro-Turkish border.\n\n[Illustration: SKETCH OF SELECTED ITEMS OF HALAFIAN ASSEMBLAGE\n\n  BEADS AND PENDANTS\n  POTTERY MOTIFS\n  POTTERY]\n\nThe Halafian assemblage is incompletely known. The culture it\nrepresents included a remarkably handsome painted pottery.\nArcheologists have tended to be so fascinated with this pottery that\nthey have bothered little with the rest of the Halafian assemblage. We\ndo know that strange stone-founded houses, with plans like those of the\npopular notion of an Eskimo igloo, were built. Like the pottery of the\nSamarran style, which appears as part of the Hassunan assemblage (see\np. 131), the Halafian painted pottery implies great concentration and\nexcellence of draftsmanship on the part of the people who painted it.\n\nWe must mention two very interesting sites adjacent to the mud-flats of\nthe rivers, half way down from northern Iraq to the classic alluvial\nMesopotamian area. One is Baghouz on the Euphrates; the other is\nSamarra on the Tigris (see map, p. 125). Both these sites yield the\nhandsome painted pottery of the style called Samarran: in fact it\nis Samarra which gives its name to the pottery. Neither Baghouz nor\nSamarra have completely Hassunan types of assemblages, and at Samarra\nthere are a few pots of proper Halafian style. I suppose that Samarra\nand Baghouz give us glimpses of those early farmers who had begun to\nfinger their way down the mud-flats of the river banks toward the\nfertile but yet untilled southland.\n\n\nCLASSIC SOUTHERN MESOPOTAMIA FIRST OCCUPIED\n\nOur next step is into the southland proper. Here, deep in the core of\nthe mound which later became the holy Sumerian city of Eridu, Iraqi\narcheologists uncovered a handsome painted pottery. Pottery of the same\ntype had been noticed earlier by German archeologists on the surface\nof a small mound, awash in the spring floods, near the remains of the\nBiblical city of Erich (Sumerian = Uruk; Arabic = Warka). This Eridu\npottery, which is about all we have of the assemblage of the people who\nonce produced it, may be seen as a blend of the Samarran and Halafian\npainted pottery styles. This may over-simplify the case, but as yet we\ndo not have much evidence to go on. The idea does at least fit with my\ninterpretation of the meaning of Baghouz and Samarra as way-points on\nthe mud-flats of the rivers half way down from the north.\n\nMy colleague, Robert Adams, believes that there were certainly\nriverine-adapted food-collectors living in lower Mesopotamia. The\npresence of such would explain why the Eridu assemblage is not simply\nthe sum of the Halafian and Samarran assemblages. But the domesticated\nplants and animals and the basic ways of food-production must have\ncome from the hilly-flanks country in the north.\n\nAbove the basal Eridu levels, and at a number of other sites in the\nsouth, comes a full-fledged assemblage called Ubaid. Incidentally,\nthere is an aspect of the Ubaidian assemblage in the north as well. It\nseems to move into place before the Halaf manifestation is finished,\nand to blend with it. The Ubaidian assemblage in the south is by far\nthe more spectacular. The development of the temple has been traced\nat Eridu from a simple little structure to a monumental building some\n62 feet long, with a pilaster-decorated faade and an altar in its\ncentral chamber. There is painted Ubaidian pottery, but the style is\nhurried and somewhat careless and gives the _impression_ of having been\na cheap mass-production means of decoration when compared with the\ncarefully drafted styles of Samarra and Halaf. The Ubaidian people made\nother items of baked clay: sickles and axes of very hard-baked clay\nare found. The northern Ubaidian sites have yielded tools of copper,\nbut metal tools of unquestionable Ubaidian find-spots are not yet\navailable from the south. Clay figurines of human beings with monstrous\nturtle-like faces are another item in the southern Ubaidian assemblage.\n\n[Illustration: SKETCH OF SELECTED ITEMS OF UBAIDIAN ASSEMBLAGE]\n\nThere is a large Ubaid cemetery at Eridu, much of it still awaiting\nexcavation. The few skeletons so far tentatively studied reveal a\ncompletely modern type of Mediterraneanoid; the individuals whom the\nskeletons represent would undoubtedly blend perfectly into the modern\npopulation of southern Iraq. What the Ubaidian assemblage says to us is\nthat these people had already adapted themselves and their culture to\nthe peculiar riverine environment of classic southern Mesopotamia. For\nexample, hard-baked clay axes will chop bundles of reeds very well, or\nhelp a mason dress his unbaked mud bricks, and there were only a few\nsoft and pithy species of trees available. The Ubaidian levels of Eridu\nyield quantities of date pits; that excellent and characteristically\nIraqi fruit was already in use. The excavators also found the clay\nmodel of a ship, with the stepping-point for a mast, so that Sinbad the\nSailor must have had his antecedents as early as the time of Ubaid.\nThe bones of fish, which must have flourished in the larger canals as\nwell as in the rivers, are common in the Ubaidian levels and thereafter.\n\n\nTHE UBAIDIAN ACHIEVEMENT\n\nOn present evidence, my tendency is to see the Ubaidian assemblage\nin southern Iraq as the trace of a new era. I wish there were more\nevidence, but what we have suggests this to me. The culture of southern\nUbaid soon became a culture of towns--of centrally located towns with\nsome rural villages about them. The town had a temple and there must\nhave been priests. These priests probably had political and economic\nfunctions as well as religious ones, if the somewhat later history of\nMesopotamia may suggest a pattern for us. Presently the temple and its\npriesthood were possibly the focus of the market; the temple received\nits due, and may already have had its own lands and herds and flocks.\nThe people of the town, undoubtedly at least in consultation with the\ntemple administration, planned and maintained the simple irrigation\nditches. As the system flourished, the community of rural farmers would\nhave produced more than sufficient food. The tendency for specialized\ncrafts to develop--tentative at best at the cultural level of the\nearlier village-farming community era--would now have been achieved,\nand probably many other specialists in temple administration, water\ncontrol, architecture, and trade would also have appeared, as the\nsurplus food-supply was assured.\n\nSouthern Mesopotamia is not a land rich in natural resources other\nthan its fertile soil. Stone, good wood for construction, metal, and\ninnumerable other things would have had to be imported. Grain and\ndates--although both are bulky and difficult to transport--and wool and\nwoven stuffs must have been the mediums of exchange. Over what area did\nthe trading net-work of Ubaid extend? We start with the idea that the\nUbaidian assemblage is most richly developed in the south. We assume, I\nthink, correctly, that it represents a cultural flowering of the south.\nOn the basis of the pottery of the still elusive Eridu immigrants\nwho had first followed the rivers into alluvial Mesopotamia, we get\nthe notion that the characteristic painted pottery style of Ubaid\nwas developed in the southland. If this reconstruction is correct\nthen we may watch with interest where the Ubaid pottery-painting\ntradition spread. We have already mentioned that there is a substantial\nassemblage of (and from the southern point of view, _fairly_ pure)\nUbaidian material in northern Iraq. The pottery appears all along the\nIranian flanks, even well east of the head of the Persian Gulf, and\nends in a later and spectacular flourish in an extremely handsome\npainted style called the Susa style. Ubaidian pottery has been noted\nup the valleys of both of the great rivers, well north of the Iraqi\nand Syrian borders on the southern flanks of the Anatolian plateau.\nIt reaches the Mediterranean Sea and the valley of the Orontes in\nSyria, and it may be faintly reflected in the painted style of a\nsite called Ghassul, on the east bank of the Jordan in the Dead Sea\nValley. Over this vast area--certainly in all of the great basin of\nthe Tigris-Euphrates drainage system and its natural extensions--I\nbelieve we may lay our fingers on the traces of a peculiar way of\ndecorating pottery, which we call Ubaidian. This cursive and even\nslap-dash decoration, it appears to me, was part of a new cultural\ntradition which arose from the adjustments which immigrant northern\nfarmers first made to the new and challenging environment of southern\nMesopotamia. But exciting as the idea of the spread of influences of\nthe Ubaid tradition in space may be, I believe you will agree that the\nconsequences of the growth of that tradition in southern Mesopotamia\nitself, as time passed, are even more important.\n\n\nTHE WARKA PHASE IN THE SOUTH\n\nSo far, there are only two radiocarbon determinations for the Ubaidian\nassemblage, one from Tepe Gawra in the north and one from Warka in the\nsouth. My hunch would be to use the dates 4500 to 3750 B.C., with a\nplus or more probably a minus factor of about two hundred years for\neach, as the time duration of the Ubaidian assemblage in southern\nMesopotamia.\n\nNext, much to our annoyance, we have what is almost a temporary\nblack-out. According to the system of terminology I favor, our next\nassemblage after that of Ubaid is called the _Warka_ phase, from\nthe Arabic name for the site of Uruk or Erich. We know it only from\nsix or seven levels in a narrow test-pit at Warka, and from an even\nsmaller hole at another site. This assemblage, so far, is known only\nby its pottery, some of which still bears Ubaidian style painting. The\ncharacteristic Warkan pottery is unpainted, with smoothed red or gray\nsurfaces and peculiar shapes. Unquestionably, there must be a great\ndeal more to say about the Warkan assemblage, but someone will first\nhave to excavate it!\n\n\nTHE DAWN OF CIVILIZATION\n\nAfter our exasperation with the almost unknown Warka interlude,\nfollowing the brilliant false dawn of Ubaid, we move next to an\nassemblage which yields traces of a preponderance of those elements\nwhich we noted (p. 144) as meaning civilization. This assemblage\nis that called _Proto-Literate_; it already contains writing. On\nthe somewhat shaky principle that writing, however early, means\nhistory--and no longer prehistory--the assemblage is named for the\nhistorical implications of its content, and no longer after the name of\nthe site where it was first found. Since some of the older books used\nsite-names for this assemblage, I will tell you that the Proto-Literate\nincludes the latter half of what used to be called the Uruk period\n_plus_ all of what used to be called the Jemdet Nasr period. It shows\na consistent development from beginning to end.\n\nI shall, in fact, leave much of the description and the historic\nimplications of the Proto-Literate assemblage to the conventional\nhistorians. Professor T. J. Jacobsen, reaching backward from the\nlegends he finds in the cuneiform writings of slightly later times, can\nin fact tell you a more complete story of Proto-Literate culture than\nI can. It should be enough here if I sum up briefly what the excavated\narcheological evidence shows.\n\nWe have yet to dig a Proto-Literate site in its entirety, but the\nindications are that the sites cover areas the size of small cities.\nIn architecture, we know of large and monumental temple structures,\nwhich were built on elaborate high terraces. The plans and decoration\nof these temples follow the pattern set in the Ubaid phase: the chief\ndifference is one of size. The German excavators at the site of Warka\nreckoned that the construction of only one of the Proto-Literate temple\ncomplexes there must have taken 1,500 men, each working a ten-hour day,\nfive years to build.\n\n\nART AND WRITING\n\nIf the architecture, even in its monumental forms, can be seen to\nstem from Ubaidian developments, this is not so with our other\nevidence of Proto-Literate artistic expression. In relief and applied\nsculpture, in sculpture in the round, and on the engraved cylinder\nseals--all of which now make their appearance--several completely\nnew artistic principles are apparent. These include the composition\nof subject-matter in groups, commemorative scenes, and especially\nthe ability and apparent desire to render the human form and face.\nExcellent as the animals of the Franco-Cantabrian art may have been\n(see p. 85), and however handsome were the carefully drafted\ngeometric designs and conventionalized figures on the pottery of the\nearly farmers, there seems to have been, up to this time, a mental\nblock about the drawing of the human figure and especially the human\nface. We do not yet know what caused this self-consciousness about\npicturing themselves which seems characteristic of men before the\nappearance of civilization. We do know that with civilization, the\nmental block seems to have been removed.\n\nClay tablets bearing pictographic signs are the Proto-Literate\nforerunners of cuneiform writing. The earliest examples are not well\nunderstood but they seem to be devices for making accounts and\nfor remembering accounts. Different from the later case in Egypt,\nwhere writing appears fully formed in the earliest examples, the\ndevelopment from simple pictographic signs to proper cuneiform writing\nmay be traced, step by step, in Mesopotamia. It is most probable\nthat the development of writing was connected with the temple and\nthe need for keeping account of the temples possessions. Professor\nJacobsen sees writing as a means for overcoming space, time, and the\nincreasing complications of human affairs: Literacy, which began\nwith ... civilization, enhanced mightily those very tendencies in its\ndevelopment which characterize it as a civilization and mark it off as\nsuch from other types of culture.\n\n[Illustration: RELIEF ON A PROTO-LITERATE STONE VASE, WARKA\n\nUnrolled drawing, with restoration suggested by figures from\ncontemporary cylinder seals]\n\nWhile the new principles in art and the idea of writing are not\nforeshadowed in the Ubaid phase, or in what little we know of the\nWarkan, I do not think we need to look outside southern Mesopotamia\nfor their beginnings. We do know something of the adjacent areas,\ntoo, and these beginnings are not there. I think we must accept them\nas completely new discoveries, made by the people who were developing\nthe whole new culture pattern of classic southern Mesopotamia. Full\ndescription of the art, architecture, and writing of the Proto-Literate\nphase would call for many details. Men like Professor Jacobsen and Dr.\nAdams can give you these details much better than I can. Nor shall I do\nmore than tell you that the common pottery of the Proto-Literate phase\nwas so well standardized that it looks factory made. There was also\nsome handsome painted pottery, and there were stone bowls with inlaid\ndecoration. Well-made tools in metal had by now become fairly common,\nand the metallurgist was experimenting with the casting process. Signs\nfor plows have been identified in the early pictographs, and a wheeled\nchariot is shown on a cylinder seal engraving. But if I were forced to\na guess in the matter, I would say that the development of plows and\ndraft-animals probably began in the Ubaid period and was another of the\ngreat innovations of that time.\n\nThe Proto-Literate assemblage clearly suggests a highly developed and\nsophisticated culture. While perhaps not yet fully urban, it is on\nthe threshold of urbanization. There seems to have been a very dense\nsettlement of Proto-Literate sites in classic southern Mesopotamia,\nmany of them newly founded on virgin soil where no earlier settlements\nhad been. When we think for a moment of what all this implies, of the\ngrowth of an irrigation system which must have existed to allow the\nflourish of this culture, and of the social and political organization\nnecessary to maintain the irrigation system, I think we will agree that\nat last we are dealing with civilization proper.\n\n\nFROM PREHISTORY TO HISTORY\n\nNow it is time for the conventional ancient historians to take over\nthe story from me. Remember this when you read what they write. Their\nreal base-line is with cultures ruled over by later kings and emperors,\nwhose writings describe military campaigns and the administration of\nlaws and fully organized trading ventures. To these historians, the\nProto-Literate phase is still a simple beginning for what is to follow.\nIf they mention the Ubaid assemblage at all--the one I was so lyrical\nabout--it will be as some dim and fumbling step on the path to the\ncivilized way of life.\n\nI suppose you could say that the difference in the approach is that as\na prehistorian I have been looking forward or upward in time, while the\nhistorians look backward to glimpse what Ive been describing here. My\nbase-line was half a million years ago with a being who had little more\nthan the capacity to make tools and fire to distinguish him from the\nanimals about him. Thus my point of view and that of the conventional\nhistorian are bound to be different. You will need both if you want to\nunderstand all of the story of men, as they lived through time to the\npresent.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of PREHISTORY\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nYoull doubtless easily recall your general course in ancient history:\nhow the Sumerian dynasties of Mesopotamia were supplanted by those of\nBabylonia, how the Hittite kingdom appeared in Anatolian Turkey, and\nabout the three great phases of Egyptian history. The literate kingdom\nof Crete arose, and by 1500 B.C. there were splendid fortified Mycenean\ntowns on the mainland of Greece. This was the time--about the whole\neastern end of the Mediterranean--of what Professor Breasted called the\nfirst great internationalism, with flourishing trade, international\ntreaties, and royal marriages between Egyptians, Babylonians, and\nHittites. By 1200 B.C., the whole thing had fragmented: the peoples of\nthe sea were restless in their isles, and the great ancient centers in\nEgypt, Mesopotamia, and Anatolia were eclipsed. Numerous smaller states\narose--Assyria, Phoenicia, Israel--and the Trojan war was fought.\nFinally Assyria became the paramount power of all the Near East,\npresently to be replaced by Persia.\n\nA new culture, partaking of older west Asiatic and Egyptian elements,\nbut casting them with its own tradition into a new mould, arose in\nmainland Greece.\n\nI once shocked my Classical colleagues to the core by referring to\nGreece as a second degree derived civilization, but there is much\ntruth in this. The principles of bronze- and then of iron-working, of\nthe alphabet, and of many other elements in Greek culture were borrowed\nfrom western Asia. Our debt to the Greeks is too well known for me even\nto mention it, beyond recalling to you that it is to Greece we owe the\nbeginnings of rational or empirical science and thought in general. But\nGreece fell in its turn to Rome, and in 55 B.C. Caesar invaded Britain.\n\nI last spoke of Britain on page 142; I had chosen it as my single\nexample for telling you something of how the earliest farming\ncommunities were established in Europe. Now I will continue with\nBritains later prehistory, so you may sense something of the end of\nprehistory itself. Remember that Britain is simply a single example\nwe select; the same thing could be done for all the other countries\nof Europe, and will be possible also, some day, for further Asia and\nAfrica. Remember, too, that prehistory in most of Europe runs on for\nthree thousand or more years _after_ conventional ancient history\nbegins in the Near East. Britain is a good example to use in showing\nhow prehistory ended in Europe. As we said earlier, it lies at the\nopposite end of Europe from the area of highest cultural achievement in\nthose times, and should you care to read more of the story in detail,\nyou may do so in the English language.\n\n\nMETAL USERS REACH ENGLAND\n\nWe left the story of Britain with the peoples who made three different\nassemblages--the Windmill Hill, the megalith-builders, and the\nPeterborough--making adjustments to their environments, to the original\ninhabitants of the island, and to each other. They had first arrived\nabout 2500 B.C., and were simple pastoralists and hoe cultivators who\nlived in little village communities. Some of them planted little if any\ngrain. By 2000 B.C., they were well settled in. Then, somewhere in the\nrange from about 1900 to 1800 B.C., the traces of the invasion of a new\nseries of peoples began to appear.\n\nThe first newcomers are called the Beaker folk, after the name of a\npeculiar form of pottery they made. The beaker type of pottery seems\noldest in Spain, where it occurs with great collective tombs of\nmegalithic construction and with copper tools. But the Beaker folk who\nreached England seem already to have moved first from Spain(?) to the\nRhineland and Holland. While in the Rhineland, and before leaving for\nEngland, the Beaker folk seem to have mixed with the local population\nand also with incomers from northeastern Europe whose culture included\nelements brought originally from the Near East by the eastern way\nthrough the steppes. This last group has also been named for a peculiar\narticle in its assemblage; the group is called the Battle-axe folk. A\nfew Battle-axe folk elements, including, in fact, stone battle-axes,\nreached England with the earliest Beaker folk,[6] coming from the\nRhineland.\n\n  [6] The British authors use the term Beaker folk to mean both\n      archeological assemblage and human physical type. They speak\n      of a ... tall, heavy-boned, rugged, and round-headed strain\n      which they take to have developed, apparently in the Rhineland,\n      by a mixture of the original (Spanish?) beaker-makers and\n      the northeast European battle-axe makers. However, since the\n      science of physical anthropology is very much in flux at the\n      moment, and since I am not able to assess the evidence for these\n      physical types, I _do not_ use the term folk in this book with\n      its usual meaning of standardized physical type. When I use\n      folk here, I mean simply _the makers of a given archeological\n      assemblage_. The difficulty only comes when assemblages are\n      named for some item in them; it is too clumsy to make an\n      adjective of the item and refer to a beakerian assemblage.\n\nThe Beaker folk settled earliest in the agriculturally fertile south\nand east. There seem to have been several phases of Beaker folk\ninvasions, and it is not clear whether these all came strictly from the\nRhineland or Holland. We do know that their copper daggers and awls\nand armlets are more of Irish or Atlantic European than of Rhineland\norigin. A few simple habitation sites and many burials of the Beaker\nfolk are known. They buried their dead singly, sometimes in conspicuous\nindividual barrows with the dead warrior in his full trappings. The\nspectacular element in the assemblage of the Beaker folk is a group\nof large circular monuments with ditches and with uprights of wood or\nstone. These henges became truly monumental several hundred years\nlater; while they were occasionally dedicated with a burial, they were\nnot primarily tombs. The effect of the invasion of the Beaker folk\nseems to cut across the whole fabric of life in Britain.\n\n[Illustration: BEAKER]\n\nThere was, however, a second major element in British life at this\ntime. It shows itself in the less well understood traces of a group\nagain called after one of the items in their catalogue, the Food-vessel\nfolk. There are many burials in these food-vessel pots in northern\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland, and the pottery itself seems to\nlink back to that of the Peterborough assemblage. Like the earlier\nPeterborough people in the highland zone before them, the makers of\nthe food-vessels seem to have been heavily involved in trade. It is\nquite proper to wonder whether the food-vessel pottery itself was made\nby local women who were married to traders who were middlemen in the\ntransmission of Irish metal objects to north Germany and Scandinavia.\nThe belt of high, relatively woodless country, from southwest to\nnortheast, was already established as a natural route for inland trade.\n\n\nMORE INVASIONS\n\nAbout 1500 B.C., the situation became further complicated by the\narrival of new people in the region of southern England anciently\ncalled Wessex. The traces suggest the Brittany coast of France as a\nsource, and the people seem at first to have been a small but heroic\ngroup of aristocrats. Their heroes are buried with wealth and\nceremony, surrounded by their axes and daggers of bronze, their gold\nornaments, and amber and jet beads. These rich finds show that the\ntrade-linkage these warriors patronized spread from the Baltic sources\nof amber to Mycenean Greece or even Egypt, as evidenced by glazed blue\nbeads.\n\nThe great visual trace of Wessex achievement is the final form of\nthe spectacular sanctuary at Stonehenge. A wooden henge or circular\nmonument was first made several hundred years earlier, but the site\nnow received its great circles of stone uprights and lintels. The\ndiameter of the surrounding ditch at Stonehenge is about 350 feet, the\ndiameter of the inner circle of large stones is about 100 feet, and\nthe tallest stone of the innermost horseshoe-shaped enclosure is 29\nfeet 8 inches high. One circle is made of blue stones which must have\nbeen transported from Pembrokeshire, 145 miles away as the crow flies.\nRecently, many carvings representing the profile of a standard type of\nbronze axe of the time, and several profiles of bronze daggers--one of\nwhich has been called Mycenean in type--have been found carved in the\nstones. We cannot, of course, describe the details of the religious\nceremonies which must have been staged in Stonehenge, but we can\ncertainly imagine the well-integrated and smoothly working culture\nwhich must have been necessary before such a great monument could have\nbeen built.\n\n\nTHIS ENGLAND\n\nThe range from 1900 to about 1400 B.C. includes the time of development\nof the archeological features usually called the Early Bronze Age\nin Britain. In fact, traces of the Wessex warriors persisted down to\nabout 1200 B.C. The main regions of the island were populated, and the\nadjustments to the highland and lowland zones were distinct and well\nmarked. The different aspects of the assemblages of the Beaker folk and\nthe clearly expressed activities of the Food-vessel folk and the Wessex\nwarriors show that Britain was already taking on her characteristic\ntrading role, separated from the European continent but conveniently\nadjacent to it. The tin of Cornwall--so important in the production\nof good bronze--as well as the copper of the west and of Ireland,\ntaken with the gold of Ireland and the general excellence of Irish\nmetal work, assured Britain a traders place in the then known world.\nContacts with the eastern Mediterranean may have been by sea, with\nCornish tin as the attraction, or may have been made by the Food-vessel\nmiddlemen on their trips to the Baltic coast. There they would have\nencountered traders who traveled the great north-south European road,\nby which Baltic amber moved southward to Greece and the Levant, and\nideas and things moved northward again.\n\nThere was, however, the Channel between England and Europe, and this\nrelative isolation gave some peace and also gave time for a leveling\nand further fusion of culture. The separate cultural traditions began\nto have more in common. The growing of barley, the herding of sheep and\ncattle, and the production of woolen garments were already features\ncommon to all Britains inhabitants save a few in the remote highlands,\nthe far north, and the distant islands not yet fully touched by\nfood-production. The personality of Britain was being formed.\n\n\nCREMATION BURIALS BEGIN\n\nAlong with people of certain religious faiths, archeologists are\nagainst cremation (for other people!). Individuals to be cremated seem\nin past times to have been dressed in their trappings and put upon a\nlarge pyre: it takes a lot of wood and a very hot fire for a thorough\ncremation. When the burning had been completed, the few fragile scraps\nof bone and such odd beads of stone or other rare items as had resisted\nthe great heat seem to have been whisked into a pot and the pot buried.\nThe archeologist is left with the pot and the unsatisfactory scraps in\nit.\n\nTentatively, after about 1400 B.C. and almost completely over the whole\nisland by 1200 B.C., Britain became the scene of cremation burials\nin urns. We know very little of the people themselves. None of their\nsettlements have been identified, although there is evidence that they\ngrew barley and made enclosures for cattle. The urns used for the\nburials seem to have antecedents in the pottery of the Food-vessel\nfolk, and there are some other links with earlier British traditions.\nIn Lancashire, a wooden circle seems to have been built about a grave\nwith cremated burials in urns. Even occasional instances of cremation\nmay be noticed earlier in Britain, and it is not clear what, if any,\nconnection the British cremation burials in urns have with the classic\n_Urnfields_ which were now beginning in the east Mediterranean and\nwhich we shall mention below.\n\nThe British cremation-burial-in-urns folk survived a long time in the\nhighland zone. In the general British scheme, they make up what is\ncalled the Middle Bronze Age, but in the highland zone they last\nuntil after 900 B.C. and are considered to be a specialized highland\nLate Bronze Age. In the highland zone, these later cremation-burial\nfolk seem to have continued the older Food-vessel tradition of being\nmiddlemen in the metal market.\n\nGranting that our knowledge of this phase of British prehistory is\nvery restricted because the cremations have left so little for the\narcheologist, it does not appear that the cremation-burial-urn folk can\nbe sharply set off from their immediate predecessors. But change on a\ngrander scale was on the way.\n\n\nREVERBERATIONS FROM CENTRAL EUROPE\n\nIn the centuries immediately following 1000 B.C., we see with fair\nclarity two phases of a cultural process which must have been going\non for some time. Certainly several of the invasions we have already\ndescribed in this chapter were due to earlier phases of the same\ncultural process, but we could not see the details.\n\n[Illustration: SLASHING SWORD]\n\nAround 1200 B.C. central Europe was upset by the spread of the\nso-called Urnfield folk, who practiced cremation burial in urns and\nwhom we also know to have been possessors of long, slashing swords and\nthe horse. I told you above that we have no idea that the Urnfield\nfolk proper were in any way connected with the people who made\ncremation-burial-urn cemeteries a century or so earlier in Britain. It\nhas been supposed that the Urnfield folk themselves may have shared\nideas with the people who sacked Troy. We know that the Urnfield\npressure from central Europe displaced other people in northern France,\nand perhaps in northwestern Germany, and that this reverberated into\nBritain about 1000 B.C.\n\nSoon after 750 B.C., the same thing happened again. This time, the\npressure from central Europe came from the Hallstatt folk who were iron\ntool makers: the reverberation brought people from the western Alpine\nregion across the Channel into Britain.\n\nAt first it is possible to see the separate results of these folk\nmovements, but the developing cultures soon fused with each other and\nwith earlier British elements. Presently there were also strains of\nother northern and western European pottery and traces of Urnfield\npractices themselves which appeared in the finished British product. I\nhope you will sense that I am vastly over-simplifying the details.\n\nThe result seems to have been--among other things--a new kind of\nagricultural system. The land was marked off by ditched divisions.\nRectangular fields imply the plow rather than hoe cultivation. We seem\nto get a picture of estate or tribal boundaries which included village\ncommunities; we find a variety of tools in bronze, and even whetstones\nwhich show that iron has been honed on them (although the scarce iron\nhas not been found). Let me give you the picture in Professor S.\nPiggotts words: The ... Late Bronze Age of southern England was but\nthe forerunner of the earliest Iron Age in the same region, not only in\nthe techniques of agriculture, but almost certainly in terms of ethnic\nkinship ... we can with some assurance talk of the Celts ... the great\nearly Celtic expansion of the Continent is recognized to be that of the\nUrnfield people.\n\nThus, certainly by 500 B.C., there were people in Britain, some of\nwhose descendants we may recognize today in name or language in remote\nparts of Wales, Scotland, and the Hebrides.\n\n\nTHE COMING OF IRON\n\nIron--once the know-how of reducing it from its ore in a very hot,\nclosed fire has been achieved--produces a far cheaper and much more\nefficient set of tools than does bronze. Iron tools seem first to\nhave been made in quantity in Hittite Anatolia about 1500 B.C. In\ncontinental Europe, the earliest, so-called Hallstatt, iron-using\ncultures appeared in Germany soon after 750 B.C. Somewhat later,\nGreek and especially Etruscan exports of _objets dart_--which moved\nwith a flourishing trans-Alpine wine trade--influenced the Hallstatt\niron-working tradition. Still later new classical motifs, together with\nolder Hallstatt, oriental, and northern nomad motifs, gave rise to a\nnew style in metal decoration which characterizes the so-called La Tne\nphase.\n\nA few iron users reached Britain a little before 400 B.C. Not long\nafter that, a number of allied groups appeared in southern and\nsoutheastern England. They came over the Channel from France and must\nhave been Celts with dialects related to those already in England. A\nsecond wave of Celts arrived from the Marne district in France about\n250 B.C. Finally, in the second quarter of the first century B.C.,\nthere were several groups of newcomers, some of whom were Belgae of\na mixed Teutonic-Celtic confederacy of tribes in northern France and\nBelgium. The Belgae preceded the Romans by only a few years.\n\n\nHILL-FORTS AND FARMS\n\nThe earliest iron-users seem to have entrenched themselves temporarily\nwithin hill-top forts, mainly in the south. Gradually, they moved\ninland, establishing _individual_ farm sites with extensive systems\nof rectangular fields. We recognize these fields by the lynchets or\nlines of soil-creep which plowing left on the slopes of hills. New\ncrops appeared; there were now bread wheat, oats, and rye, as well as\nbarley.\n\nAt Little Woodbury, near the town of Salisbury, a farmstead has been\nrather completely excavated. The rustic buildings were within a\npalisade, the round house itself was built of wood, and there were\nvarious outbuildings and pits for the storage of grain. Weaving was\ndone on the farm, but not blacksmithing, which must have been a\nspecialized trade. Save for the lack of firearms, the place might\nalmost be taken for a farmstead on the American frontier in the early\n1800s.\n\nToward 250 B.C. there seems to have been a hasty attempt to repair the\nhill-forts and to build new ones, evidently in response to signs of\nrestlessness being shown by remote relatives in France.\n\n\nTHE SECOND PHASE\n\nPerhaps the hill-forts were not entirely effective or perhaps a\ncompromise was reached. In any case, the newcomers from the Marne\ndistrict did establish themselves, first in the southeast and then to\nthe north and west. They brought iron with decoration of the La Tne\ntype and also the two-wheeled chariot. Like the Wessex warriors of\nover a thousand years earlier, they made heroes graves, with their\nwarriors buried in the war-chariots and dressed in full trappings.\n\n[Illustration: CELTIC BUCKLE]\n\nThe metal work of these Marnian newcomers is excellent. The peculiar\nCeltic art style, based originally on the classic tendril motif,\nis colorful and virile, and fits with Greek and Roman descriptions\nof Celtic love of color in dress. There is a strong trace of these\nnewcomers northward in Yorkshire, linked by Ptolemys description to\nthe Parisii, doubtless part of the Celtic tribe which originally gave\nits name to Paris on the Seine. Near Glastonbury, in Somerset, two\nvillages in swamps have been excavated. They seem to date toward the\nmiddle of the first century B.C., which was a troubled time in Britain.\nThe circular houses were built on timber platforms surrounded with\npalisades. The preservation of antiquities by the water-logged peat of\nthe swamp has yielded us a long catalogue of the materials of these\nvillagers.\n\nIn Scotland, which yields its first iron tools at a date of about 100\nB.C., and in northern Ireland even slightly earlier, the effects of the\ntwo phases of newcomers tend especially to blend. Hill-forts, brochs\n(stone-built round towers) and a variety of other strange structures\nseem to appear as the new ideas develop in the comparative isolation of\nnorthern Britain.\n\n\nTHE THIRD PHASE\n\nFor the time of about the middle of the first century B.C., we again\nsee traces of frantic hill-fort construction. This simple military\narchitecture now took some new forms. Its multiple ramparts must\nreflect the use of slings as missiles, rather than spears. We probably\nknow the reason. In 56 B.C., Julius Caesar chastised the Veneti of\nBrittany for outraging the dignity of Roman ambassadors. The Veneti\nwere famous slingers, and doubtless the reverberations of escaping\nVeneti were felt across the Channel. The military architecture suggests\nthat some Veneti did escape to Britain.\n\nAlso, through Caesar, we learn the names of newcomers who arrived in\ntwo waves, about 75 B.C. and about 50 B.C. These were the Belgae. Now,\nat last, we can even begin to speak of dynasties and individuals.\nSome time before 55 B.C., the Catuvellauni, originally from the Marne\ndistrict in France, had possessed themselves of a large part of\nsoutheastern England. They evidently sailed up the Thames and built a\ntown of over a hundred acres in area. Here ruled Cassivellaunus, the\nfirst man in England whose name we know, and whose town Caesar sacked.\nThe town sprang up elsewhere again, however.\n\n\nTHE END OF PREHISTORY\n\nPrehistory, strictly speaking, is now over in southern Britain.\nClaudius effective invasion took place in 43 A.D.; by 83 A.D., a raid\nhad been made as far north as Aberdeen in Scotland. But by 127 A.D.,\nHadrian had completed his wall from the Solway to the Tyne, and the\nRomans settled behind it. In Scotland, Romanization can have affected\nthe countryside very little. Professor Piggott adds that ... it is\nwhen the pressure of Romanization is relaxed by the break-up of the\nDark Ages that we see again the Celtic metal-smiths handling their\nmaterial with the same consummate skill as they had before the Roman\nConquest, and with traditional styles that had not even then forgotten\ntheir Marnian and Belgic heritage.\n\nIn fact, many centuries go by, in Britain as well as in the rest of\nEurope, before the archeologists task is complete and the historian on\nhis own is able to describe the ways of men in the past.\n\n\nBRITAIN AS A SAMPLE OF THE GENERAL COURSE OF PREHISTORY IN EUROPE\n\nIn giving this very brief outline of the later prehistory of Britain,\nyou will have noticed how often I had to refer to the European\ncontinent itself. Britain, beyond the English Channel for all of her\nlater prehistory, had a much simpler course of events than did most of\nthe rest of Europe in later prehistoric times. This holds, in spite\nof all the invasions and reverberations from the continent. Most\nof Europe was the scene of an even more complicated ebb and flow of\ncultural change, save in some of its more remote mountain valleys and\npeninsulas.\n\nThe whole course of later prehistory in Europe is, in fact, so very\ncomplicated that there is no single good book to cover it all;\ncertainly there is none in English. There are some good regional\naccounts and some good general accounts of part of the range from about\n3000 B.C. to A.D. 1. I suspect that the difficulty of making a good\nbook that covers all of its later prehistory is another aspect of what\nmakes Europe so very complicated a continent today. The prehistoric\nfoundations for Europes very complicated set of civilizations,\ncultures, and sub-cultures--which begin to appear as history\nproceeds--were in themselves very complicated.\n\nHence, I selected the case of Britain as a single example of how\nprehistory ends in Europe. It could have been more complicated than we\nfound it to be. Even in the subject matter on Britain in the chapter\nbefore the last, we did not see direct traces of the effect on Britain\nof the very important developments which took place in the Danubian\nway from the Near East. Apparently Britain was not affected. Britain\nreceived the impulses which brought copper, bronze, and iron tools from\nan original east Mediterranean homeland into Europe, almost at the ends\nof their journeys. But by the same token, they had had time en route to\ntake on their characteristic European aspects.\n\nSome time ago, Sir Cyril Fox wrote a famous book called _The\nPersonality of Britain_, sub-titled Its Influence on Inhabitant and\nInvader in Prehistoric and Early Historic Times. We have not gone\ninto the post-Roman early historic period here; there are still the\nAnglo-Saxons and Normans to account for as well as the effects of\nthe Romans. But what I have tried to do was to begin the story of\nhow the personality of Britain was formed. The principles that Fox\nused, in trying to balance cultural and environmental factors and\ninterrelationships would not be greatly different for other lands.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nIn the pages you have read so far, you have been brought through the\nearliest 99 per cent of the story of mans life on this planet. I have\nleft only 1 per cent of the story for the historians to tell.\n\n\nTHE DRAMA OF THE PAST\n\nMen first became men when evolution had carried them to a certain\npoint. This was the point where the eye-hand-brain co-ordination was\ngood enough so that tools could be made. When tools began to be made\naccording to sets of lasting habits, we know that men had appeared.\nThis happened over a half million years ago. The stage for the play\nmay have been as broad as all of Europe, Africa, and Asia. At least,\nit seems unlikely that it was only one little region that saw the\nbeginning of the drama.\n\nGlaciers and different climates came and went, to change the settings.\nBut the play went on in the same first act for a very long time. The\nmen who were the players had simple roles. They had to feed themselves\nand protect themselves as best they could. They did this by hunting,\ncatching, and finding food wherever they could, and by taking such\nprotection as caves, fire, and their simple tools would give them.\nBefore the first act was over, the last of the glaciers was melting\naway, and the players had added the New World to their stage. If\nwe want a special name for the first act, we could call it _The\nFood-Gatherers_.\n\nThere were not many climaxes in the first act, so far as we can see.\nBut I think there may have been a few. Certainly the pace of the\nfirst act accelerated with the swing from simple gathering to more\nintensified collecting. The great cave art of France and Spain was\nprobably an expression of a climax. Even the ideas of burying the dead\nand of the Venus figurines must also point to levels of human thought\nand activity that were over and above pure food-getting.\n\n\nTHE SECOND ACT\n\nThe second act began only about ten thousand years ago. A few of the\nplayers started it by themselves near the center of the Old World part\nof the stage, in the Near East. It began as a plant and animal act, but\nit soon became much more complicated.\n\nBut the players in this one part of the stage--in the Near East--were\nnot the only ones to start off on the second act by themselves. Other\nplayers, possibly in several places in the Far East, and certainly in\nthe New World, also started second acts that began as plant and animal\nacts, and then became complicated. We can call the whole second act\n_The Food-Producers_.\n\n\nTHE FIRST GREAT CLIMAX OF THE SECOND ACT\n\nIn the Near East, the first marked climax of the second act happened\nin Mesopotamia and Egypt. The play and the players reached that great\nclimax that we call civilization. This seems to have come less than\nfive thousand years after the second act began. But it could never have\nhappened in the first act at all.\n\nThere is another curious thing about the first act. Many of the players\ndidnt know it was over and they kept on with their roles long after\nthe second act had begun. On the edges of the stage there are today\nsome players who are still going on with the first act. The Eskimos,\nand the native Australians, and certain tribes in the Amazon jungle are\nsome of these players. They seem perfectly happy to keep on with the\nfirst act.\n\nThe second act moved from climax to climax. The civilizations of\nMesopotamia and Egypt were only the earliest of these climaxes. The\nplayers to the west caught the spirit of the thing, and climaxes\nfollowed there. So also did climaxes come in the Far Eastern and New\nWorld portions of the stage.\n\nThe greater part of the second act should really be described to you\nby a historian. Although it was a very short act when compared to the\nfirst one, the climaxes complicate it a great deal. I, a prehistorian,\nhave told you about only the first act, and the very beginning of the\nsecond.\n\n\nTHE THIRD ACT\n\nAlso, as a prehistorian I probably should not even mention the third\nact--it began so recently. The third act is _The Industrialization_.\nIt is the one in which we ourselves are players. If the pace of the\nsecond act was so much faster than that of the first, the pace of the\nthird act is terrific. The danger is that it may wear down the players\ncompletely.\n\nWhat sort of climaxes will the third act have, and are we already in\none? You have seen by now that the acts of my play are given in terms\nof modes or basic patterns of human economy--ways in which people\nget food and protection and safety. The climaxes involve more than\nhuman economy. Economics and technological factors may be part of the\nclimaxes, but they are not all. The climaxes may be revolutions in\ntheir own way, intellectual and social revolutions if you like.\n\nIf the third act follows the pattern of the second act, a climax should\ncome soon after the act begins. We may be due for one soon if we are\nnot already in it. Remember the terrific pace of this third act.\n\n\nWHY BOTHER WITH PREHISTORY?\n\nWhy do we bother about prehistory? The main reason is that we think it\nmay point to useful ideas for the present. We are in the troublesome\nbeginnings of the third act of the play. The beginnings of the second\nact may have lessons for us and give depth to our thinking. I know\nthere are at least _some_ lessons, even in the present incomplete\nstate of our knowledge. The players who began the second act--that of\nfood-production--separately, in different parts of the world, were not\nall of one pure race nor did they have pure cultural traditions.\nSome apparently quite mixed Mediterraneans got off to the first start\non the second act and brought it to its first two climaxes as well.\nPeoples of quite different physical type achieved the first climaxes in\nChina and in the New World.\n\nIn our British example of how the late prehistory of Europe worked, we\nlisted a continuous series of invasions and reverberations. After\neach of these came fusion. Even though the Channel protected Britain\nfrom some of the extreme complications of the mixture and fusion of\ncontinental Europe, you can see how silly it would be to refer to a\npure British race or a pure British culture. We speak of the United\nStates as a melting pot. But this is nothing new. Actually, Britain\nand all the rest of the world have been melting pots at one time or\nanother.\n\nBy the time the written records of Mesopotamia and Egypt begin to turn\nup in number, the climaxes there are well under way. To understand the\nbeginnings of the climaxes, and the real beginnings of the second act\nitself, we are thrown back on prehistoric archeology. And this is as\ntrue for China, India, Middle America, and the Andes, as it is for the\nNear East.\n\nThere are lessons to be learned from all of mans past, not simply\nlessons of how to fight battles or win peace conferences, but of how\nhuman society evolves from one stage to another. Many of these lessons\ncan only be looked for in the prehistoric past. So far, we have only\nmade a beginning. There is much still to do, and many gaps in the story\nare yet to be filled. The prehistorians job is to find the evidence,\nto fill the gaps, and to discover the lessons men have learned in the\npast. As I see it, this is not only an exciting but a very practical\ngoal for which to strive.\n\n\n\n\nList of Books\n\n\nBOOKS OF GENERAL INTEREST\n\n(Chosen from a variety of the increasingly useful list of cheap\npaperbound books.)\n\n  Childe, V.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org \n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary \nArchive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s web site and\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n', ""import time, os, sys\nimport transposition_cipher as transCipher\n\ndef main():\n    inputFile = 'Prehistoric Men.txt'\n    outputFile = 'Output.txt'\n    key = int(input('Enter key: '))\n    mode = input('Encrypt/Decrypt [e/d]: ')\n\n    if not os.path.exists(inputFile):\n        print('File %s does not exist.
